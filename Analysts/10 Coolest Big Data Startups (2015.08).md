CRN 10- Big Data Start ups

Big data remains one of the fastest-growing segments of the IT industry with researcher Wikibon predicting that the big data technology market will grow nearly 22 percent to $33.31 billion this year.

In the last year, it seems the focus among startups in the big data arena has been on helping businesses more easily and effectively analyze data and derive value from it. They include companies offering technology for analyzing data in Hadoop and realtime streaming data, and companies providing software that brings big data analytics capabilities to everyday business workers.
