## Myths about Statistics & Big Data
### [Seven Myths About Big Data](https://datafloq.com/read/seven-myths-about-big-data/155)
It may be clear that there is enough information to be found on the web regarding big data. Everyone has a different explanation of big data and what it can mean for organisations. With so much information around big data to be found, it is easy to become confused and to read the wrong information. So let’s dispel some of the most common big data myths and big data strategies.

1. Big Data is New
90% of the available data has been created in the last two years and the term big data has been around 2005, when it was launched by O’Reilly Media in 2005.  However, the usage of big data and the need to understand all available data has been around much longer. There are a lot of examples of companies that were into big data before it was called big data. A well-known example is Walmart that has been using data analytics already for many years.

2. Big Data is Just a Hype
Big data is not something like social media, which indeed was a hype a few years back. At the beginning of social media everyone thought that social media was the Holy Grail, well it ended differently. Social media is just a marketing tool to better understand you customers. Big data on the other hand is a transformative trend that will mean a paradigm shift in all industries for all companies, big or small. The amount of data will only grow in the coming years and all that data can be turned into information that can be used to improve organisations in many different ways. Already, companies that have developed and implemented a big data strategy financially outperform their peers by 20%. This will only increase and companies that will not move into the direction of big data most probably will not be able to survive in the future.

3. You Need to Have a Lot of Data to Talk About Big Data
Big data does not necessarily have to be a lot of data. Although Volume is one of the three V’s that is generally used to describe big data, it is definitely not a requirement to have a minimum of for example a Petabyte of data. Especially the combination of different data sets (such as  combining company data with social data and public data ) provides a lot of insights and this can also happen with smaller data sets.

4. Big Data is Only for Large Corporations
A small business has to look differently at big data, simply because less data is created. That does not mean however that small businesses cannot develop a big data strategy. Especially when small businesses start combining various data sets they can also obtain the insights that large corporations achieve with big data. It will however probably take a bit longer before small organizations will start to see the benefits of developing a big data strategy.

5. You Need to Hire a Big Data Scientist to Start With Big Data
There are many big data startups that offer innovative tools for companies as a SaaS or DaaS (Data-as-a-Service) solution. For each aspect of big data (processing, storing, analysing, visualizing) there are different startups that offer such a SaaS or DaaS solution. For these solutions there is no need at all to build a Hadoop cluster and to hire an expensive big data scientist or big data analyst.

6. Hadoop is the Holy Grail of Big Data
Hadoop offers a lot of advantages such as massive amounts of data that can be easily stored, processed and analyzed in a fraction of a second. It uses commodity hardware and can easily be scaled at relatively low costs. Combined with a fault tolerance system that copies all data several times over different clusters and nodes, Hadoop offers a lot of advantages. However, Hadoop is not the Holy Grail. There are quite some substantial disadvantages of Hadoop. Getting Hadoop operational is difficult and requires specialized engineers that are expensive. Subsequently cluster management is hard and debugging is pretty difficult and without a top layer real-time analytics is not possible. Therefore, using Hadoop is not a guarantee for success.

7. A Big Data Strategy is an IT Responsibility
Quite often, big data is seen as an IT matter, after all you need hardware and software to implement a big data strategy. It is true that the hardware and software need to be developed by highly skilled technical big data employees (in-house or outsourced). This is nothing strange, as the required IT of big data is different from what we have had so far. However, the required IT is merely a means to an end to achieve a big data strategy defined by the organization. This strategy could be “to increase customer satisfaction” or “to increase revenue” or “to improve the operational efficiency” and the route to achieve that strategy could be big data or any other solution for that matter. If the strategy is “to increase customer satisfaction” it would be strange to define it an IT matter or have the IT Director be the sponsor of the strategy. Therefore, big data is a strategy matter that should be dealt with, ideally, at board level.

## [Deep Learning vs Machine Learning vs Pattern Recognition](http://www.computervisionblog.com/2015/03/deep-learning-vs-machine-learning-vs.html)
Machine Learning is here to stay. Don't think about it as Pattern Recognition vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning, just realize that each term emphasizes something a little bit different.  But the search continues.  Go ahead and explore. Break something. We will continue building smarter software and our algorithms will continue to learn, but we've only begun to explore the kinds of architectures that can truly rule-them-all.

## [Machine learning explained in simple words](http://nkonst.com/machine-learning-explained-simple-words/)
ML works with data and processes it to discover patterns that can be later used to analyse new data. ML usually relies on specific representation of data, a set of “features” that are understandable for a computer. For example, if we are talking about text it should be represented through the words it contains or some other characteristics such as length of the text, number of emotional words etc. This presentation depends on the task you are dealing with and is typically referred to as “feature extraction”.

## [What is the difference between a data scientist and a business intelligence analyst?](http://devres.zoomquiet.io/data/20121120180245/index.html)

They sound like they're pretty much identical except in title. The flashier SV startups like to call it "data scientist" and the e-commerce, old commerce, etc. companies like to call it "business intelligence." True?
  
I think the question Big Data: Will 'data scientists' live up to the expectations or will 'big data' be a disappointment? has some answers that are relevant to this question.

- While there's a lot of people who argue both ways, I generally find that the following differences are generally accepted:
   - Data scientists work with a mix of Big Data tools such as Hadoop/Map-Reduce/Hive, NoSQL, MPPs, traditional databases, and basically anything that stores/has data.  They also tend to have a stronger technology skill set in that they also programmers, and also have very strong math skills particularly in thing like statistics.  I've also seen that a data scientist would generally need to know how to do data visualization.  The data scientist also needs to have a strong understanding of the business as they typically would work directly with the business.  I believe this is a role in which realistically very few people could fill, even with extensive training.
   - A BI Analyst would be a person who works with BI tools to perform analysis. Generally speaking they would be a person who is somewhat educated on data warhousing and understands how a star schema is modeled.  This allows them to do things such as perform ad-hoc analysis either through a reporting tool or using SQL to create the charts, graphs, excel sheets, etc that the business users require.  They can also serve as the middleman between business and IT when creating new BI functionality.  Basically will work more with the technology and business users as opposed to trying to play that single role.

Комментарии, правда, весьма противоречивые.

## [What is the difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Mining](http://shakthydoss.com/what-is-the-difference-between-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-statistics-and-data-mining/)

I assume the author of that question is trying to get a clear picture by understanding the line of separation that distinguish each field from the other. So here is my take to explain it in a more simplified way that I ever could do.

Machine learning is a science that involves development of self-learning algorithms. These algorithms are more generic in nature that it can be applied to various domain related problems.

Data mining is a practice of applying algorithms (mostly Machine learning algorithms) with the data available from domain to solve domain related problems.

Statistics is a study of how to collect, organizes, analyze, and interpret numerical information from data. Statistics can slip into two taxonomy called Descriptive statistics and Inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics involves method of organizing, summering and picturing information from data. Inferential statistics invokes method of using information from sample to draw conclusion about the population.

Machine learning uses statistics (mostly inferential statistics) to develop self learning algorithms.

Data mining uses statistics (mostly Descriptive statistics) on results obtained from algorithms, it used to solve the problem.

Data mining as a field emerged to solve problems in the miscellaneous domain (particularity in business), acquired different techniques and practices that are used in different field of studies.

In 1960 practitioners who solved problems (mostly business problems) used term Data fishing to call the work they do. In 1989 Gregory Piatetsky Shapiro used term knowledge Discovery in the Database (KDD). In 1990 a company used term Data mining with the trademark to represent their work. Today data mining and KDD are used interchangeably.

Artificial Intelligence is a science to develop a system or software to mimic human to respond and behave in a circumference. As field with extremely broad scope, AI has defined its goal into multiple chunks. Later each chuck has become a separate field of study to solve its problem.

## [What's the difference between data mining, machine learning and deep learning?](http://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html)

The difference between machine learning and other statistical and mathematical approaches, such as data mining, is another popular subject of debate. In simple terms, while machine learning uses many of the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, **one difference lies in what the two disciplines predict**.

- Data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge.
- Machine learning is used to reproduce known patterns and knowledge, automatically apply that to other data, and then automatically apply those results to decision making and actions.

## 10 Reasons of Why I Love Data Analytics by Paul Balm
[Source](http://www.amadeus.com/blog/04/06/10-reasons-why-i-love-data-and-analytics/ "Permalink to 10 Reasons of Why I Love Data Analytics by Paul Balm")

_![Data Science][1]Editor's note: It's been labelled the sexiest profession of the 21st Century, one where demand has raced ahead of supply, a hybrid of data hacker, analyst, communicator, and trusted advisor. [Data scientists][2] __are people with the skill set (and the mind-set) to tame Big Data technologies and put them to good use. But what kind of person does this? Who has that powerful –and rare- combination of skills?  In this series, Amadeus' team of [Data Scientists][2] __seek to unlock the answers to those questions and their impact on travel._

Not long ago, I was in a job interview at a small software start-up. This was the third round of interviews and they were being very thorough in the selection process.  After an hour or so, the interviewers fell silent. "We actually don't think you're a very good fit for this position we have", said one of them, "but we believe that you could be our data scientist." It was at this point that I discovered my love for data and analytics. I went on to find my current job as a Data Scientist with the Travel Intelligence unit at Amadeus – and eventually I came to wonder, what exactly is it that is so fulfilling about working as a data scientist? After a little consideration, I've identified ten reasons why I love data and analytics.

1. **Data and analytics allow us to make informed decisions – and to stop guessing.** I was never fond of making decisions based on gut feeling, perhaps because the gut says one thing one day, and something quite different the following day. The data 'is what it is' – even if [it can also be easily abused][3].
2. **Who likes to argue?** Data analysis provides objective answers that can put an end to an argument. The added benefit is that, being the data scientist in the discussion, you are at a clear advantage!
3. **Businesses need to make trade-offs**. Airlines can trade yield for load, or the other way around; travel agencies need to spend their advertising budget with maximum effect. Data and analytics can have real influence on the decisions a business takes, and on the outcome.

Aside from the business impact, for me there are more personal reasons for loving my new professional field as well.

4. **It's exciting.** At the risk of making overly bold statements, the tools for handling large amounts of data and doing analytics are quite possibly advancing more rapidly than any other technology field today. With better tools, comes better understanding of how we should be doing analytics and how we should use the resulting information, all of which is evolving extremely fast.
5. **It satisfies curiosity**. You might be sitting at an airport looking at aircrafts come and go, docking at the gates, boarding passengers and taking off again, and wonder… Whatever questions you may have, it's likely that analysis of data flowing through Amadeus' systems can answer them.
6. **It's mysterious**. Tell me: [What][4] [is][5] [data][6] [science][7]?  In such a new field, finding consensus around one single definition is hard. But in my opinion, data science is the process of creating (business) value from data. One of the best definitions of [Big Data][8] I've come across is: "Big Data is data that is so large that its volume becomes a problem in its own right." Not only understanding the data, or how to make predictions based on the data, but the very fact that there's so much of it that even something as simple as calculating final ticket fares requires specialised technology. That's one of the things that sets data science apart from statistics.
7. **It can be applied to many different domains**. In my job, I'm applying data science to travel industry data – tickets, schedules, bookings, searches – and to data that is not necessarily travel industry data, but that somehow affects travel, like currency exchange rates or weather data. But data science can be applied to many domains. For example, if you have investments, how are they doing and why?
8. **What about money?** Well… Who married his partner for money? Put your hand down!  I don't think money is often a factor that leads to love, or even fondness, but the current scarcity of data scientists in the job market, the attention from recruiters, and the appreciation in the workplace, certainly helps.
9. Looking back at my CV with fresh eyes, I now realise I also love data because **it makes so much sense**. I studied Physics and have a PhD in Science. After that, I worked on data processing for scientific projects. Why, since I had done Science as well as worked with data, did it not occur to me earlier I might like data science? Now if you needed any more convincing arguments about the excitement in data, analytics and being a data scientist, there is the media to proclaim that:
10. [Data Scientist is the sexiest job of the 21st century!][9]

In a future post in this series, we will take up the last of these in more detail. Stay tuned!

	1. Prototyping. For every question, think about how to get the best answer if only given 1 hour, 1 day, and 1 week. A one-off prototype can lead to a discussion that renders the 1 week version obsolete. Design and analyze experiments that help you decide whether the prototype achieves its goal.
	1. Data carpentry. Dealing with data may require parsing JSON, dealing with UTF-8, writing SQL and Hive queries, a one-off sed command, and so on. Know how to extract features that might be help you understand or model the data.
	1. Exploration. Know a plotting library like ggplot or bokeh, and know how to make interactive visualizations when appropriate. Projects should have a dashboard containing plots that help you tell a story about what you have found.
	1. Problem formulation. Know which methods will give you a good enough answer, e.g. for classification problems will logistic regression be sufficient, or is it worth switching to GBMs, factorization machines, or a neural net? For each model, be familiar with using good implementations and know how to tune them. For each model, know how to explain what features are important according to the model.
	1. Sharing. Be able to explain your results accurately. Each project should have a one-line, big-picture lesson or takeaway. Use git and have a README for all your projects. Write well-commented code that is optimized for collaboration and reproducibility.
	1. Optimization. If you’re using R or Python, know how to use Rcpp/numba/cython, etc. to make your inner loops fast. Be able to write your code in Java/C++/Rust if necessary. Be able to distribute embarrassingly parallel jobs using a cluster (or AWS if you don’t have one).

### 9 Must-Have Skills You Need to Become a Data Scientist
[Source](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/11/9-must-have-skills-data-scientist.html "Permalink to 9 Must-Have Skills You Need to Become a Data Scientist")

Burtch Works details the top 9 data science skills that potential data scientists must have to be competitive in this growing marketplace from the perspective of a recruiter.

by Burtch Works, Nov 2014.

![][1] Over the past year, interest in data science has soared. [Nate Silver][2] is a household name, companies everywhere are [searching for unicorns][3], and professionals in many different disciplines have begun eyeing the [well-salaried profession][4] as a possible career move.

In our recruiting searches here at Burtch Works, we've spoken to many analytics professionals who are considering adapting their skills to the growing field of data science, and have questions about how to do so. From my perspective as a recruiter, I wanted to put together a list of technical and non-technical skills that are critical to success in data science, and at the top of hiring managers' lists.

Every company will value skills and tools a bit differently, and this is by no means an [exhaustive list][5], but if you have experience in these areas you will be making a strong case for yourself as a data science candidate.

**Technical Skills: Analytics**

1. **Education** – Data scientists are highly educated – 88% have at least a Master's degree and 46% have PhDs – and while there are notable exceptions, a very strong educational background is usually required to develop the depth of knowledge necessary to be a data scientist. Their most common fields of study are Mathematics and Statistics (32%), followed by Computer Science (19%) and Engineering (16%).
2. **SAS and/or R** – In-depth knowledge of at least one of these analytical tools, for data science R is generally preferred.

**Technical Skills: Computer Science**

3. **Python Coding** – Python is the most common coding language I typically see required in data science roles, along with Java, Perl, or C/C++.
4. **Hadoop Platform** – Although this isn't always a requirement, it is heavily preferred in many cases. Having experience with Hive or Pig is also a strong selling point. Familiarity with cloud tools such as Amazon S3 can also be beneficial.
5. **SQL Database/Coding** – Even though NoSQL and Hadoop have become a large component of data science, it is still expected that a candidate will be able to write and execute complex queries in SQL.
6. **Unstructured data** – It is critical that a data scientist be able to work with unstructured data, whether it is from social media, video feeds or audio.

**Non-Technical Skills **

7. **Intellectual curiosity **– No doubt you've seen this phrase everywhere lately, especially as it relates to data scientists. Frank Lo describes what it means, and talks about other necessary "soft skills" in his [guest blog][6] posted a few months ago.
8. **Business acumen **– To be a data scientist you'll need a solid understanding of the industry you're working in, and know what business problems your company is trying to solve. In terms of data science, being able to discern which problems are important to solve for the business is critical, in addition to identifying new ways the business should be leveraging its data.
9. **Communication skills **– Companies searching for a strong data scientist are looking for someone who can clearly and fluently translate their technical findings to a non-technical team, such as the Marketing or Sales departments. A data scientist must enable the business to make decisions by arming them with quantified insights, in addition to understanding the needs of their non-technical colleagues in order to wrangle the data appropriately. Check out [our recent flash survey][7] for more information on communication skills for quantitative professionals.

![Computer and Book][8]

The next question I always get is, "What can I do to develop these skills?" There are many resources around the web, but I don't want to give anyone the mistaken impression that the path to data science is as simple as taking a few MOOCs. Unless you already have a strong quantitative background, the road to becoming a data scientist will be challenging – but not impossible.

However, if it's something you're sincerely interested in, and have a passion for data and lifelong learning, don't let your background discourage you from pursuing data science as a career. Here are a few of the resources we've found to be helpful:

**Resources**

1. **Advanced Degree** – More [Data Science programs][9] are popping up to serve the current demand, but there are also many Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science [programs][10].
2. **MOOCs** –[Coursera][11], [Udacity][12], and [codeacademy][13] are good places to start.
3. **Certifications** – KDnuggets has [compiled an extensive list][14].
4. **Bootcamps** – For more information about how this approach compares to degree programs or MOOCs, [check out this guest blog][15] from the data scientists at Datascope Analytics.
5. **Kaggle** – [Kaggle][16] hosts data science competitions where you can practice, hone your skills with messy, real world data, and tackle actual business problems. Employers take Kaggle rankings seriously, as they can be seen as relevant, hands-on project work.
6. **LinkedIn Groups** – Join relevant groups to interact with other members of the data science community.
7. **Data Science Central and KDnuggets** – [Data Science Central][17] and [KDnuggets][18] are good resources for staying at the forefront of industry trends in data science.
8. **The Burtch Works Study: Salaries of Data Scientists** – If you're looking for more information about the salaries and demographics of current data scientists be sure to [download our data scientist salary study][4].

I'm sure there are items I may have missed, so if there's a crucial skill or resource you think would be helpful to any data science hopefuls, feel free to share it in the comments below!

## About DS workflow
- [Learning to learn, or the advent of augmented data scientists](https://medium.com/the-programmable-chronicles/learning-to-learn-or-the-advent-of-augmented-data-scientists-20873282e181)
The typical data scientist workflow, when you consider it from defining the problem at hand to debugging a live production system is, in our experience, very intricate and certainly not linear. Thankfully, this process can easily be broken down into distinct parts. Rich Caruana (Microsoft Research) formulates the following pipeline, which feels very familiar for us:
	- Problem definition
	- Data collection
	- Data cleaning
	- Data coding (feature engineering)
	- Metric selection
	- Algorithm selection
	- Parameter optimization
	- Post-processing
	- Deployment
	- Online evaluation
	- Debug

Data science interviews are the worst because data science is interdisciplinary: code for “you have to know everything about all the disciplines.”  Depending on the company and the team, your interview might look like a software developer’s interview, or it might look a like a statistician’s interview, and the bad news is that virtually none of the material overlaps.  I recently spent a ton of time studying for interviews and I’ve got some hot tips to pass along if you’re thinking about a move soon.
