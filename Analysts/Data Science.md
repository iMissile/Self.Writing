## Myths about Statistics & Big Data
### [Seven Myths About Big Data](https://datafloq.com/read/seven-myths-about-big-data/155)
It may be clear that there is enough information to be found on the web regarding big data. Everyone has a different explanation of big data and what it can mean for organisations. With so much information around big data to be found, it is easy to become confused and to read the wrong information. So let’s dispel some of the most common big data myths and big data strategies.

1. Big Data is New
90% of the available data has been created in the last two years and the term big data has been around 2005, when it was launched by O’Reilly Media in 2005.  However, the usage of big data and the need to understand all available data has been around much longer. There are a lot of examples of companies that were into big data before it was called big data. A well-known example is Walmart that has been using data analytics already for many years.

2. Big Data is Just a Hype
Big data is not something like social media, which indeed was a hype a few years back. At the beginning of social media everyone thought that social media was the Holy Grail, well it ended differently. Social media is just a marketing tool to better understand you customers. Big data on the other hand is a transformative trend that will mean a paradigm shift in all industries for all companies, big or small. The amount of data will only grow in the coming years and all that data can be turned into information that can be used to improve organisations in many different ways. Already, companies that have developed and implemented a big data strategy financially outperform their peers by 20%. This will only increase and companies that will not move into the direction of big data most probably will not be able to survive in the future.

3. You Need to Have a Lot of Data to Talk About Big Data
Big data does not necessarily have to be a lot of data. Although Volume is one of the three V’s that is generally used to describe big data, it is definitely not a requirement to have a minimum of for example a Petabyte of data. Especially the combination of different data sets (such as  combining company data with social data and public data ) provides a lot of insights and this can also happen with smaller data sets.

4. Big Data is Only for Large Corporations
A small business has to look differently at big data, simply because less data is created. That does not mean however that small businesses cannot develop a big data strategy. Especially when small businesses start combining various data sets they can also obtain the insights that large corporations achieve with big data. It will however probably take a bit longer before small organizations will start to see the benefits of developing a big data strategy.

5. You Need to Hire a Big Data Scientist to Start With Big Data
There are many big data startups that offer innovative tools for companies as a SaaS or DaaS (Data-as-a-Service) solution. For each aspect of big data (processing, storing, analysing, visualizing) there are different startups that offer such a SaaS or DaaS solution. For these solutions there is no need at all to build a Hadoop cluster and to hire an expensive big data scientist or big data analyst.

6. Hadoop is the Holy Grail of Big Data
Hadoop offers a lot of advantages such as massive amounts of data that can be easily stored, processed and analyzed in a fraction of a second. It uses commodity hardware and can easily be scaled at relatively low costs. Combined with a fault tolerance system that copies all data several times over different clusters and nodes, Hadoop offers a lot of advantages. However, Hadoop is not the Holy Grail. There are quite some substantial disadvantages of Hadoop. Getting Hadoop operational is difficult and requires specialized engineers that are expensive. Subsequently cluster management is hard and debugging is pretty difficult and without a top layer real-time analytics is not possible. Therefore, using Hadoop is not a guarantee for success.

7. A Big Data Strategy is an IT Responsibility
Quite often, big data is seen as an IT matter, after all you need hardware and software to implement a big data strategy. It is true that the hardware and software need to be developed by highly skilled technical big data employees (in-house or outsourced). This is nothing strange, as the required IT of big data is different from what we have had so far. However, the required IT is merely a means to an end to achieve a big data strategy defined by the organization. This strategy could be “to increase customer satisfaction” or “to increase revenue” or “to improve the operational efficiency” and the route to achieve that strategy could be big data or any other solution for that matter. If the strategy is “to increase customer satisfaction” it would be strange to define it an IT matter or have the IT Director be the sponsor of the strategy. Therefore, big data is a strategy matter that should be dealt with, ideally, at board level.

## [Deep Learning vs Machine Learning vs Pattern Recognition](http://www.computervisionblog.com/2015/03/deep-learning-vs-machine-learning-vs.html)
Machine Learning is here to stay. Don't think about it as Pattern Recognition vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning, just realize that each term emphasizes something a little bit different.  But the search continues.  Go ahead and explore. Break something. We will continue building smarter software and our algorithms will continue to learn, but we've only begun to explore the kinds of architectures that can truly rule-them-all.

## [What is the difference between a data scientist and a business intelligence analyst?](http://devres.zoomquiet.io/data/20121120180245/index.html)

They sound like they're pretty much identical except in title. The flashier SV startups like to call it "data scientist" and the e-commerce, old commerce, etc. companies like to call it "business intelligence." True?
  
I think the question Big Data: Will 'data scientists' live up to the expectations or will 'big data' be a disappointment? has some answers that are relevant to this question.

- While there's a lot of people who argue both ways, I generally find that the following differences are generally accepted:
   - Data scientists work with a mix of Big Data tools such as Hadoop/Map-Reduce/Hive, NoSQL, MPPs, traditional databases, and basically anything that stores/has data.  They also tend to have a stronger technology skill set in that they also programmers, and also have very strong math skills particularly in thing like statistics.  I've also seen that a data scientist would generally need to know how to do data visualization.  The data scientist also needs to have a strong understanding of the business as they typically would work directly with the business.  I believe this is a role in which realistically very few people could fill, even with extensive training.
   - A BI Analyst would be a person who works with BI tools to perform analysis. Generally speaking they would be a person who is somewhat educated on data warhousing and understands how a star schema is modeled.  This allows them to do things such as perform ad-hoc analysis either through a reporting tool or using SQL to create the charts, graphs, excel sheets, etc that the business users require.  They can also serve as the middleman between business and IT when creating new BI functionality.  Basically will work more with the technology and business users as opposed to trying to play that single role.

## [What is the difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Mining](http://shakthydoss.com/what-is-the-difference-between-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-statistics-and-data-mining/)

I assume the author of that question is trying to get a clear picture by understanding the line of separation that distinguish each field from the other. So here is my take to explain it in a more simplified way that I ever could do.

Machine learning is a science that involves development of self-learning algorithms. These algorithms are more generic in nature that it can be applied to various domain related problems.

Data mining is a practice of applying algorithms (mostly Machine learning algorithms) with the data available from domain to solve domain related problems.

Statistics is a study of how to collect, organizes, analyze, and interpret numerical information from data. Statistics can slip into two taxonomy called Descriptive statistics and Inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics involves method of organizing, summering and picturing information from data. Inferential statistics invokes method of using information from sample to draw conclusion about the population.

Machine learning uses statistics (mostly inferential statistics) to develop self learning algorithms.

Data mining uses statistics (mostly Descriptive statistics) on results obtained from algorithms, it used to solve the problem.

Data mining as a field emerged to solve problems in the miscellaneous domain (particularity in business), acquired different techniques and practices that are used in different field of studies.

In 1960 practitioners who solved problems (mostly business problems) used term Data fishing to call the work they do. In 1989 Gregory Piatetsky Shapiro used term knowledge Discovery in the Database (KDD). In 1990 a company used term Data mining with the trademark to represent their work. Today data mining and KDD are used interchangeably.

Artificial Intelligence is a science to develop a system or software to mimic human to respond and behave in a circumference. As field with extremely broad scope, AI has defined its goal into multiple chunks. Later each chuck has become a separate field of study to solve its problem.

## [What's the difference between data mining, machine learning and deep learning?](http://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html)

The difference between machine learning and other statistical and mathematical approaches, such as data mining, is another popular subject of debate. In simple terms, while machine learning uses many of the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, **one difference lies in what the two disciplines predict**.

- Data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge.
- Machine learning is used to reproduce known patterns and knowledge, automatically apply that to other data, and then automatically apply those results to decision making and actions.

## 10 Reasons of Why I Love Data Analytics by Paul Balm
[Source](http://www.amadeus.com/blog/04/06/10-reasons-why-i-love-data-and-analytics/ "Permalink to 10 Reasons of Why I Love Data Analytics by Paul Balm")

_![Data Science][1]Editor's note: It's been labelled the sexiest profession of the 21st Century, one where demand has raced ahead of supply, a hybrid of data hacker, analyst, communicator, and trusted advisor. [Data scientists][2] __are people with the skill set (and the mind-set) to tame Big Data technologies and put them to good use. But what kind of person does this? Who has that powerful –and rare- combination of skills?  In this series, Amadeus' team of [Data Scientists][2] __seek to unlock the answers to those questions and their impact on travel._

Not long ago, I was in a job interview at a small software start-up. This was the third round of interviews and they were being very thorough in the selection process.  After an hour or so, the interviewers fell silent. "We actually don't think you're a very good fit for this position we have", said one of them, "but we believe that you could be our data scientist." It was at this point that I discovered my love for data and analytics. I went on to find my current job as a Data Scientist with the Travel Intelligence unit at Amadeus – and eventually I came to wonder, what exactly is it that is so fulfilling about working as a data scientist? After a little consideration, I've identified ten reasons why I love data and analytics.

1. **Data and analytics allow us to make informed decisions – and to stop guessing.** I was never fond of making decisions based on gut feeling, perhaps because the gut says one thing one day, and something quite different the following day. The data 'is what it is' – even if [it can also be easily abused][3].
2. **Who likes to argue?** Data analysis provides objective answers that can put an end to an argument. The added benefit is that, being the data scientist in the discussion, you are at a clear advantage!
3. **Businesses need to make trade-offs**. Airlines can trade yield for load, or the other way around; travel agencies need to spend their advertising budget with maximum effect. Data and analytics can have real influence on the decisions a business takes, and on the outcome.

Aside from the business impact, for me there are more personal reasons for loving my new professional field as well.

4. **It's exciting.** At the risk of making overly bold statements, the tools for handling large amounts of data and doing analytics are quite possibly advancing more rapidly than any other technology field today. With better tools, comes better understanding of how we should be doing analytics and how we should use the resulting information, all of which is evolving extremely fast.
5. **It satisfies curiosity**. You might be sitting at an airport looking at aircrafts come and go, docking at the gates, boarding passengers and taking off again, and wonder… Whatever questions you may have, it's likely that analysis of data flowing through Amadeus' systems can answer them.
6. **It's mysterious**. Tell me: [What][4] [is][5] [data][6] [science][7]?  In such a new field, finding consensus around one single definition is hard. But in my opinion, data science is the process of creating (business) value from data. One of the best definitions of [Big Data][8] I've come across is: "Big Data is data that is so large that its volume becomes a problem in its own right." Not only understanding the data, or how to make predictions based on the data, but the very fact that there's so much of it that even something as simple as calculating final ticket fares requires specialised technology. That's one of the things that sets data science apart from statistics.
7. **It can be applied to many different domains**. In my job, I'm applying data science to travel industry data – tickets, schedules, bookings, searches – and to data that is not necessarily travel industry data, but that somehow affects travel, like currency exchange rates or weather data. But data science can be applied to many domains. For example, if you have investments, how are they doing and why?
8. **What about money?** Well… Who married his partner for money? Put your hand down!  I don't think money is often a factor that leads to love, or even fondness, but the current scarcity of data scientists in the job market, the attention from recruiters, and the appreciation in the workplace, certainly helps.
9. Looking back at my CV with fresh eyes, I now realise I also love data because **it makes so much sense**. I studied Physics and have a PhD in Science. After that, I worked on data processing for scientific projects. Why, since I had done Science as well as worked with data, did it not occur to me earlier I might like data science? Now if you needed any more convincing arguments about the excitement in data, analytics and being a data scientist, there is the media to proclaim that:
10. [Data Scientist is the sexiest job of the 21st century!][9]
