## [What is the difference between a data scientist and a business intelligence analyst?](http://devres.zoomquiet.io/data/20121120180245/index.html)

They sound like they're pretty much identical except in title. The flashier SV startups like to call it "data scientist" and the e-commerce, old commerce, etc. companies like to call it "business intelligence." True?
  
I think the question Big Data: Will 'data scientists' live up to the expectations or will 'big data' be a disappointment? has some answers that are relevant to this question.

- While there's a lot of people who argue both ways, I generally find that the following differences are generally accepted:
   - Data scientists work with a mix of Big Data tools such as Hadoop/Map-Reduce/Hive, NoSQL, MPPs, traditional databases, and basically anything that stores/has data.  They also tend to have a stronger technology skill set in that they also programmers, and also have very strong math skills particularly in thing like statistics.  I've also seen that a data scientist would generally need to know how to do data visualization.  The data scientist also needs to have a strong understanding of the business as they typically would work directly with the business.  I believe this is a role in which realistically very few people could fill, even with extensive training.
   - A BI Analyst would be a person who works with BI tools to perform analysis. Generally speaking they would be a person who is somewhat educated on data warhousing and understands how a star schema is modeled.  This allows them to do things such as perform ad-hoc analysis either through a reporting tool or using SQL to create the charts, graphs, excel sheets, etc that the business users require.  They can also serve as the middleman between business and IT when creating new BI functionality.  Basically will work more with the technology and business users as opposed to trying to play that single role.

## [What is the difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Mining](http://shakthydoss.com/what-is-the-difference-between-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-statistics-and-data-mining/)

I assume the author of that question is trying to get a clear picture by understanding the line of separation that distinguish each field from the other. So here is my take to explain it in a more simplified way that I ever could do.

Machine learning is a science that involves development of self-learning algorithms. These algorithms are more generic in nature that it can be applied to various domain related problems.

Data mining is a practice of applying algorithms (mostly Machine learning algorithms) with the data available from domain to solve domain related problems.

Statistics is a study of how to collect, organizes, analyze, and interpret numerical information from data. Statistics can slip into two taxonomy called Descriptive statistics and Inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics involves method of organizing, summering and picturing information from data. Inferential statistics invokes method of using information from sample to draw conclusion about the population.

Machine learning uses statistics (mostly inferential statistics) to develop self learning algorithms.

Data mining uses statistics (mostly Descriptive statistics) on results obtained from algorithms, it used to solve the problem.

Data mining as a field emerged to solve problems in the miscellaneous domain (particularity in business), acquired different techniques and practices that are used in different field of studies.

In 1960 practitioners who solved problems (mostly business problems) used term Data fishing to call the work they do. In 1989 Gregory Piatetsky Shapiro used term knowledge Discovery in the Database (KDD). In 1990 a company used term Data mining with the trademark to represent their work. Today data mining and KDD are used interchangeably.

Artificial Intelligence is a science to develop a system or software to mimic human to respond and behave in a circumference. As field with extremely broad scope, AI has defined its goal into multiple chunks. Later each chuck has become a separate field of study to solve its problem.

The difference between machine learning and other statistical and mathematical approaches, such as data mining, is another popular subject of debate. In simple terms, while machine learning uses many of the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, **one difference lies in what the two disciplines predict**.

- Data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge.
- Machine learning is used to reproduce known patterns and knowledge, automatically apply that to other data, and then automatically apply those results to decision making and actions.
