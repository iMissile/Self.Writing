# DCVS - Distributed Control Version System

- Git comes with built-in GUI tools for committing (git-gui) and browsing (gitk), but there are several [third-party tools](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) for users looking for platform-specific experience.
- [Git for Windows](http://msysgit.github.io/). We bring the awesome Git SCM to Windows
- [the Hg-Git mercurial plugin](http://hg-git.github.io/) This is the Hg-Git plugin for Mercurial, adding the ability to push to and pull from a Git server repository from Mercurial. This means you can collaborate on Git based projects from Mercurial, or use a Git server as a collaboration point for a team with developers using both Git and Mercurial.
