# Bossies 2015: The Best of Open Source Software Awards
[Source](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2984437/open-source-tools/bossies-2015-the-best-of-open-source-software-awards.html "Permalink to Bossies 2015: The Best of Open Source Software Awards")

Whenever you hear someone complain about developer productivity, just slap them. Having slogged through hundreds of open source projects each year for the past several years, I can assure you that developers are _extremely productive_. Every time we put together this package -- InfoWorld's annual Best of Open Source Awards, aka the Bossies -- I end up wishing developers were just a little less on the ball.

Of course I had help. InfoWorld is fortunate to draw on many contributors who work as software developers, systems integrators, data scientists, security consultants, and networking gurus in real life. If there's an open source tool in their domain they don't already know, they're eager to dive in. Thanks to the hard work of these experts, our 2015 Bossies encompass some 100 winners in six categories:
- [Bossie Awards 2015: The best open source applications](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2982622/bossie-awards-2015-the-best-open-source-applications.html)
- [Bossie Awards 2015: The best open source application development tools](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2982920/bossie-awards-2015-the-best-open-source-application-development-tools.html)
- [Bossie Awards 2015: The best open source big data tools](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2982429/bossie-awards-2015-the-best-open-source-big-data-tools.html)
- [Bossie Awards 2015: The best open source data center and cloud software](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2982923/bossie-awards-2015-the-best-open-source-data-center-and-cloud-software.html)
- [Bossie Awards 2015: The best open source desktop and mobile software](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2982630/bossie-awards-2015-the-best-open-source-desktop-and-mobile-software.html)
- [Bossie Awards 2015: The best open source networking and security software](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2982962/bossie-awards-2015-the-best-open-source-networking-and-security-software.html)

Where do we find all of these winners? We hang out in the places that open source gathers. We take in the conferences, we hit the meetups, we climb the mountains of open source known as GitHub and Sourceforge -- and the hill of open source, CodePlex. (RIP, Google Code.)&nbsp;We never miss OSCON, and wherever we go, we keep our eyes and our ears open. When a leading light such as Joyent's [Bryan Cantrill reveals a tech crush][1] (RethinkDB, recently), we zero in for a close look.
