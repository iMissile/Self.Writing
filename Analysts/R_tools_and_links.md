- [Two-table verbs](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/two-table.html). It’s rare that a data analysis involves only a single table of data. In practice, you’ll normally have many tables that contribute to an analysis, and you need flexible tools to combine them. In dplyr, there are three families of verbs that work with two tables at a time:
	- Mutating joins, which add new variables to one table from matching rows in another.
	- Filtering joins, which filter observations from one table based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.
	- Set operations, which combine the observations in the data sets as if they were set elements.

## Spatial Statistics
The question concerns calculating the correlation between two irregularly sampled time series (one-dimensional stochastic processes) and using that to find the time offset where they are maximally correlated (their "phase difference").

This problem is not usually addressed in time series analysis, because time series data are presumed to be collected systematically (at regular intervals of time). It is rather the province of geostatistics, which concerns the multidimensional generalizations of time series. The archetypal geostatistical dataset consists of measurements of geological samples at irregularly spaced locations.
