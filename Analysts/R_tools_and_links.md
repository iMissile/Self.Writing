- [Two-table verbs](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/two-table.html). It’s rare that a data analysis involves only a single table of data. In practice, you’ll normally have many tables that contribute to an analysis, and you need flexible tools to combine them. In dplyr, there are three families of verbs that work with two tables at a time:
	- Mutating joins, which add new variables to one table from matching rows in another.
	- Filtering joins, which filter observations from one table based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.
	- Set operations, which combine the observations in the data sets as if they were set elements.

	- [tidyjson](https://github.com/sailthru/tidyjson) is a complementary set of tools to tidyr for working with JSON data. It's primary objective is to turn JSON data into tidy tables for downstream use by dplyr or other relational, analytical or machine learning frameworks in R. Behind the scenes, tidyjson uses jsonlite to parse the JSON data. tidyjson is also designed to be used with the %>% operator imported into dplyr from the magrittr package.
	- [Why use tidyjson?](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyjson/vignettes/introduction-to-tidyjson.html)
There are already several libraries for working with JSON data in R, such as rjson, rjsonio and jsonlite. Using these libraries, you can transform JSON into a nested R list. However, working with nested lists using base R functionality is difficult.

## подвал
	Solution: the pipe operator from magrittr
	x %>% f(y) -> f(x, y)
	Hint: pronounce %>% as then

	Purrr: Anonymous functions are verbose in R, so we provide two convenient shorthands. 
	For predicate functions, ~ .x + 1 is equivalent to function(.x) .x + 1. 
	For chains of transformations functions, . %>% f() %>% g() is equivalent to function(.) . %>% f() %>% g().

- [Treasure Trove of R Scripts for Auto Classification, Chart Generation, Solr, Mongo, MySQL and Ton More](https://github.com/datadolphyn/R)
In this repository hosted at github, the datadolph.in team is sharing all of the R codebase that it developed to analyze large quantities of data.
datadolph.in team has benefited tremendously from fellow R bloggers and other open source communities and is proud to contribute all of its codebase into the community.
The codebase includes ETL and integration scripts on -
 - R-Solr Integration
 - R-Mongo Interaction
 - R-MySQL Interaction
 - Fetching, cleansing and transforming data
 - Classification (identify column types)
 - Default chart generation (based on simple heuristics and matching a dimension with a measure)

## Scheduling tools
- [Mistral](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mistral). Mistral is a workflow service. Most business processes consist of multiple distinct interconnected steps that need to be executed in a particular order in a distributed environment. One can describe such process as a set of tasks and task relations and upload such description to Mistral so that it takes care of state management, correct execution order, parallelism, synchronization and high availability. Mistral also provides flexible task scheduling so that we can run a process according to a specified schedule (i.e. every Sunday at 4.00pm) instead of running it immediately. We call such set of tasks and relations between them a workflow.
- [MS Azure Scheduler](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/scheduler/). [Get started with Azure Scheduler in Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/scheduler-get-started-portal/)
- [scheduleR](https://github.com/Bart6114/scheduleR/) is a framework that can be used to deploy R tasks, reports and apps.
- [taskscheduleR](https://github.com/jwijffels/taskscheduleR). Schedule R scripts/processes with the Windows task scheduler. This allows R users working on Windows to automate R processes on specific timepoints from R itself. [Sample](http://www.bnosac.be/index.php/blog/56-taskscheduler-r-package-to-schedule-r-scripts-with-the-windows-task-manager) If you are working on a Windows computer and want to schedule your R scripts while you are off running, sleeping or having a coffee break, the taskscheduleR package might be what you are looking for.

Lyra also provides a data pipeline interface for iterative visual specification of data transformations and layout algorithms. Lyra is more expressive than interactive systems like Tableau, allowing designers to create custom visualizations comparable to hand-coded visualizations built with D3 or Processing. These visualizations can then be easily published and reused on the Web.

## Spatial Statistics
The question concerns calculating the correlation between two irregularly sampled time series (one-dimensional stochastic processes) and using that to find the time offset where they are maximally correlated (their "phase difference").

This problem is not usually addressed in time series analysis, because time series data are presumed to be collected systematically (at regular intervals of time). It is rather the province of geostatistics, which concerns the multidimensional generalizations of time series. The archetypal geostatistical dataset consists of measurements of geological samples at irregularly spaced locations.
