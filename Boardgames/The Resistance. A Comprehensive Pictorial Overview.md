# So you're wondering about the new edition of The Resistance: A Definitive Guide with Pictures | The Resistance

![][1]

**Introducing The Resistance**  

![][2]

  
It's no secret that I'm a big fan of the game [**The Resistance][3]**, a social deduction game designed by Don Eskridge in the style of the ever-popular Werewolf. In this game, players assume the role of either a Resistance freedom fighter, or a spy for a repressive government that is trying to thwart the efforts of the Resistance rebels. The fun part is that these roles are assigned secretly, meaning that you don't know whether or not other players are on your team. Players must then vote together to decide which of them goes on a mission, which will either pass or fail - the outcome depending on the secret votes cast by those who go on the mission. And here is where the heart of the game kicks in: players will use discussion, deception and intuition in an attempt to identify the members of the opposing force and ensure victory for their team.

If ever a game had the potential to pack an incredible social game experience in a box, The Resistance is exactly that kind of party game! It's a superb social game, very similar in feel to the well-known Mafia or Werewolf, but arguably better. How could a social game be better than Werewolf? Well, for one thing, there's no player elimination. There's also room for more deduction, because players have more data to work with, based on how players vote and based on the outcome of various missions. It also handles smaller groups from as few as five or six players. So if you enjoy social games with hidden roles, and if you're a fan of Werewolf in particular, The Resistance is essential!

When I first posted a review for The Resistance, it had just been published as part of the [Postcard Box Games series][4], along with [Triumvirate][5] and [Haggis][6]. Since its original release, the game has attracted a devoted fan-base and has generated some serious momentum in the game industry, which is great news for its designer and for its small publisher, Indie Boards &amp; Cards, run by the dedicated Travis Worthington. Now in 2012 a new edition of the game has appeared, which enhances and improves on its aesthetics even further. In this overview, I won't be covering the rules or gameplay (for that consult my [original review][7]), because this new edition changes none of the rules. Instead this article is intended primarily as guide to the new edition, for people wondering what it looks like, and how it compares with the first edition of the game.

**Box**

The game box of the new edition features attractive artwork that immediately brings to mind some of the intrigue that's inside the box.

![][8]

  
_Box cover of the new edition_

The back of the box includes an overview of the game. Unlike the multilingual first edition (which was in English, German, and French), it's immediately evident that this is an English only edition.

![][9]

**How it compares with the previous edition**

Aside from being an English only edition instead of multi-lingual, the most noticeable difference with the new edition is the larger size of the box, which undoubtedly helps give the game a more impressive presentation on game store shelves. The new edition does replace many of the cards from the original version with chips, so that may also account for the larger box. Having a solid plastic insert with two compartments (one for the cards, the other for the other components) is also a welcome improvement.

**Components**

Let's pull everything out of the box and give you a complete list of what you get with the game.

![][11]

  
_Everything you get inside the box_

● 10 Character Cards  
● 3 Score Tableaus (double-sided)  
● 5 Score markers (double-sided)  
● 1 Leader token  
● 5 Team tokens  
● 15 Plot cards  
● 20 Vote tokens  
● 10 Mission Cards  
● 15 Plot Cards  
● Round marker &amp; Vote marker  
● Instructions

This overview explains what is what:

![][12]

**Character cards**

The character cards are the cards that are secretly dealt to players to determine which team they're on. There are six resistance characters and four spy characters, each with unique artwork. The cards feature a quality linen finish and attractive artwork.

![][13]

  
_Six Resistance operatives and four Spies_

**How it compares with the previous edition**

The artwork on these cards is unchanged, although you'll notice that slightly different icons are used to represent the resistance and spy teams. The card quality has received a definite upgrade however, as is immediately evident from the quality linen finish on the cards in the new edition.

![][14]

**Scoring tableaus &amp; markers**

The new edition comes with three double sided scoring tableaus, meaning that there is an appropriate tableau for each number of players (5-10). The artwork is unique on each of these tableaus, but more importantly they contain the information specific to playing with that number of players, i.e. how many people go on each mission. They're made of thin card.

![][15]

To keep track of missions won or lost, there are five double-sided tokens, which are placed on the scoring tableau depending on who won the mission - resistance artwork on one side, spy artwork on the reverse.

![][16]

  
_Scoring tokens for the Resistance team and Spies_

There's also two additional tokens, a round marker to keep track of the rounds, and a voting track marker to keep track of how many consecutive attempts there have been for making a team (which is important to keep track of, because five failed votes in a row means that the Spies win the game).

![][17]

**How it compares with the previous edition**

The boards of the original edition are larger than the single board of the original, although their made of cardstock instead of cardboard. But the big advantage of having multiple boards is that you can dispense with the need to consult a separate chart to figure out how many people go on a mission. Granted, it's not rocket science to figure this out, but it makes the game so much easier to teach to new players when all the information is right on the table in front of them. Having a voting track to keep track of how many attempts there have been to make a team is also a helpful addition.

![][18]

**Team tokens**

The Mission leader (who proposes teams) has his own token, in order to clearly and visibly designate which player this is.

![][19]

  
_Token for the mission leader_

There are five cardboard team tokens that are used by the mission leader to indicate who he is proposing to be on a team. Each has individual artwork, not that this has any game-play significance, but it adds to the coolness effect.

![][20]

  
_Tokens for the team members_

**How it compares with the previous edition**

Using cardboard tokens is a solid improvement, because the original edition of the game used cards for this purpose. Cards are good, but sometimes there are just too many cards floating around on the table, and it can become difficult to keep everything organized and separate. Using tokens instead is a great touch, and also makes it easier to distribute and place these in front of players.

![][21]

**Vote tokens**

Players will indicate whether or not they support a proposed team by using vote tokens, each player getting two (Approve and Reject). These are handy cardboard tokens and are very clearly labelled.

![][22]

**How it compares with the previous edition**

These are a further improvement on the original, which used cards for the same purpose - as mentioned already, this helps avoid players needing to manipulate a large number of cards. Adding the words "accept" and "reject" on the cards is also a sensible addition, just to prevent any ambiguity, especially for new players.

![][23]

**Mission cards**

These are what players who go on a mission use to indicate whether it succeeds or fails.

![][24]

  
_Mission cards of the new edition_

**How it compares with the previous edition**

Aside from improved card quality, adding the words "Success" and "Fail" is another sensible improvement. Most of us who have played the game will have had times when new players needed to ask which card represented success and which represented failure. While it may seem obvious, including the text prevents any possible misunderstanding.

![][25]

**Plot Thickens cards**

These cards represent the expansion, which is more or less essential when playing with larger numbers of players.

![][26]

  
_Some sample Plot Thickens cards from the new edition_

**How it compares with the previous edition**

The original game did already include these cards, but they were text-only, and the fact that they were multi-lingual didn't exactly help matters. These cards are not only better quality and more beautiful to look at (I love the artwork!), but they're also a significant functional improvement. Note that these upgraded cards were available separately from the BGG store at one time (I myself bought a copy at the time, in order to do a simple upgrade to my game), but the ones that come with the new edition feature higher quality production. There is a small change to the artwork on the back as well, so they're not exactly identical to the BGG promos.

![][27]

**Rules**

The new edition comes with an English language rulebook, which includes all the rules for the Plot expansion cards as well.

![][28]

  
_Sample spread from the new rulebook_

**How it compares with the previous edition**

The rulebook is larger in size than the original rulebook. Rather than having a separate sheet for the Plot expansion cards, these rules are now included in the one set of instructions, which is a sensible moved. The rules themselves have benefited from some minor revisions to ensure that they are 100% accurate (the very first print run of the game had a couple of minor errors). They also include strategy tips for both Spies and Resistance players.

**Recommendation**

[**The Resistance][3]** has certainly come a long way from its humble beginnings. This new edition doesn't introduce any gameplay changes, since only the components have been upgraded. Having said that, these new components are all very sensible improvements, and should help bring this excellent game to new audiences. If you don't yet own a copy of the game and have been considering getting it, this new edition absolutely makes buying this a no-brainer. If you have the first edition of the game, there's no real reason to rush out and replace it with the new edition, although at the very least I'd recommend picking up the Plot Thickens cards with revised artwork from the BGG Store if they're still available when you're reading this. But if you play and enjoy the game a lot, then perhaps this new edition is probably a must have anyway. Gamers who really enjoy The Resistance will be immensely pleased with the improved components of the new edition, since virtually all the changes are upgrades. Here's hoping that this new edition will help get this gem into the hands of even more gamers around the world! Highly recommended!
