If you've looked past this game, thinking it's just another [Railways of the World][3] expansion, then think again. Inside this box, which modestly pretends to be just another expansion, are two completely separate games. You get:  
1\. Railways of England &amp; Wales: [BASIC Railroad Tycoon Expansion][4]  
2\. Railways of England &amp; Wales: [ADVANCED Share System][5]  
But strangely enough, the two games have very little to do with each other, aside from the fact that they both use some Railroad Tycoon components, and share some concepts. For the most part, the second game is quite different from the first, and strictly speaking is not even part of the Railroad Tycoon series but requires separate treatment.

I'm rather ignorant when it comes to business models and marketing. But in my limited way of thinking it doesn't seem to be the most brilliant marketing strategy to package a new Wallace game as merely an "Advanced" version of an expansion. Maybe the marketing team missed an excellent opportunity to pitch this as a brand new Martin Wallace train game? Which it is! So maybe some reviews will help clarify what isn't immediately obvious from initial appearances, and this review intends to help that process.

![][6]

Just to be clear, what's in this box is not an entirely independent game. It needs components from 2005's [Railroad Tycoon][3] (or it's 2009 re-implementation: [Railways of the World][3]). But assuming you've got one of those two base games (which are almost identical), then this package will give you two games for the price of one:  
1\. another excellent expansion for Railroad Tycoon.  
2\. a completely new game from Martin Wallace that happens to use Railroad Tycoon components.

This review is the first of a three-part series, and the aim of this instalment is to introduce you to Martin Wallace and his train games, and to [Railways of England and Wales][7] in particular. In the next two instalments, I'll walk you through the two games inside the box, but for now let's give a quick overview of what you get for your money with this game.

**Introducing Martin Wallace**

Britain's [Martin Wallace][8] is currently one of the world's leading game designers. Originally a substitute teacher but now a full-time designer, he has a passion for games, his first successful title being [Lords of Creation][9] in 1993. Since then, he has earned a solid reputation for designing complex games that blend some of the best elements of mechanics from Euro style games along with solid themes from American style games. As Wallace himself [observed][10], "I always start with the theme. Then it is a case of finding mechanics that will fit the theme." And [elsewhere][11]: "Theme always comes first for me." The themes are often historical, as he [notes][12], "I nearly always start with a theme. A lot of my games, especially the Warfrog ones, have historical themes. My usual approach is to read a few books and then try to draw out what the important features were of the period. Then it is a case of coming up with the mechanics." Wallace's complex strategy games are often themed around civilizations (e.g. [Struggle of Empires][13], and [Rise of Empires][14]) and trains. It's especially his train games that are the focus of this review.

![][15]

Another train game from Martin Wallace? It seems hard to believe, because there hasn't been much buzz about it. We heard lots of hype about [Steam][16] months before it showed up in stores, but very little has been said to promote the new train game inside this box. But it's true: beneath the wrapping paper of the [Railways of England and Wales][7] expansion for Railroad Tycoon, is a brand new train game from Martin Wallace.

**Introducing Martin Wallace's train games**

But we can only properly appreciate the contents of this new box when we place it in the context of Martin Wallace's other designs, and trace how his train games have developed. When an [interviewer][17] observed that Wallace has designed a lot of rail games, his response was telling: "I've actually only designed two railway games, all the rest are developments of those two. [Ferrocarriles Pampas][18] went on to spawn [Prairie][19] and [Pampas Rails][20], while [Lancashire Railways][21] begat [Volldampf][22], [Age of Steam][23] and [Railroad Tycoon][3]. [Steel Driver][24] is a development of the former series, it's a stripped down version of [Prairie Rails][19]."

Essentially Wallace sees himself as the designer of two families or systems of train games, each of which had their own development:  
1\. [Ferrocarriles Pampas][18] \--&gt; [Prairie Railroads][25], [Pampas Railroads][26], [Steel Driver][24]   
2\. [Lancashire Railways][21] \--&gt; [Volldampf][22], [Age of Steam][23], [Railroad Tycoon][3] (= [Railways of the World][3]), [Steam][16]  
Generally speaking, Steel Driver and Railroad Tycoon would classify as the "lighter" members of each family.

Martin Wallace's love affair with train games began relatively early in his design career. Wallace [says][12] it was only because John Bohrer asked him to design a railway game that he got on board designing train games in the first place. He wanted to design something "quicker and simpler than 18xx", and the seeds of success were first sown in [Ferrocarriles Pampas][18] (which became Prairie Railroads and Pampas Railroads) and [Lancashire Railways][21] (which became Age of Steam). The core delivery mechanic evident here paved the way for the more mature designs he perfected in later games. Since Wallace really hit the big time with his shining [Age of Steam][23], we'll start our summary there - mainly for the benefit of those not that familiar with the Wallace train families, and trying to figure out the relationship between the different games and which of the newer ones to buy.

**2002 [Age of Steam][23]**

![][27]

Created by Wallace and developed by John Bohrer, this is the heavy-weight train game that won various awards (including the 2003 International Gamers Award for Best General Strategy Game) and at one time was in the BGG Top 10. More of a tough, brain-burning experience for serious gamers, this is arguably his _magnus opus_. In an [interview][10] Wallace credits Bohrer's significant contribution in helping develop this game from Lancashire Railways. Wallace [considers][28] Age of Steam his "dream game", since it is "a railway game that looks good, doesn't take forever to play, and is fun." He [states][12] "It would be fair to say it is my best railway game." But the train ride of success didn't end there.

**2005 [Railroad Tycoon][3]**

![][29]

In collaboration with Glenn Drover, the mechanics and game-play of Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined, and attractive over-produced components were added, making the game more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience. In Wallace's [own words][12]: "What I attempted to do is strip AoS down to a more basic, faster moving version. The emphasis is firmly on track building. The auctions and special actions have gone, shares are easier - you get to take them out as you need them. It is designed for a wider audience than the original AoS was." Railroad Tycoon spawned two expansion maps (Europe and England), and the attempt to appeal to a wider audience was a definite success.

**2009 [Steam][16]**

![][30]

Developer John Bohrer and Eagle Games produced a [third edition][31] of Age of Steam in 2008, featuring more over-produced components similar to Railroad Tycoon. But Wallace himself completely reworked his original 2002 game with all new artwork and rules under the new name of [Steam][16]. Steam comes with two rule-sets: "Standard" rules (offering a more intense and tight game like the classic Age of Steam), and "Basic" rules (offering a more forgiving and quicker game). The expansion [Steam Barons][32] adds a stock-market system to the game.

**2009 [Railways of the World][3]**

![][33]

Railways of the World re-implements Railroad Tycoon, with the benefit of some tweaks and minor improvements first seen in the two expansions, [Railways of Europe][34] and [Railways of England and Wales][7]. [Railways of the World][3] is expected to be released at any time, and almost certainly represents Wallace's medium-weight railroad game at its best, being at the end of the process of evolutionary curve of development that began already before Age of Steam.

All of these games are essentially the same system, but have been refined and improved over time. So this means that today the modern train gamer and Wallace fan has several options:  
1\. Heavy-weight game: [Age of Steam][23], or [Steam][16] Standard.  
2\. Medium-weight game: [Railroad Tycoon][3] (replacing [Railways of the World][3]), or [Steam][16] Basic.

But now there's a new heavier-weight contender from Wallace we need to add to this list, although it diverges more sharply from the existing curve of development:

**2009 [Railways of England and Wales][7] Advanced Share System**

![][35]

More than just a Rails of the World expansion, this box also includes rules for an all-new complex train game from Wallace. So let's find out more!

**Introducing Martin Wallace's _newest_ train game **

Technically, this product is marketed as another expansion for the [Railways of the World][3] series, much like the Rails of Europe. In fact, it plays a lot like Rails of Europe, but on an England map. But there's a big difference: the Railways of England rulebook has a separate section describing an Advanced game. But the Advanced game is not part of the Railroad Tycoon evolutionary curve of development, even though some of the same components are used. The Railroad Baron cards, Railroad Operation cards, New City tiles and Engine cards are all not used for this game. In their place are Share certificates, Share markers, Shares Issued and Available Shares boxes, and Company tiles. In other words, it's a completely different game with a very different feel! Experienced gamers who've played it suggest that it is more akin to the [18xx series][36] or to [Imperial][37] than to Age of Steam.

![][38]

Let's find out more about what comes with this expansion!

**Game Box**

The box front features a train – no surprise there! Aha, I even spy Martin Wallace's name on the cover!

![][39]

The back of the box showcases the map, some of the components, and tells us a little about what we get inside.

![][40]

The actual size of the box is the same as the Rails of Europe expansion box. For comparison, here's the expansion with its older sibling (Rails of Europe), and mother (Railroad Tycoon):

![][41]

**Components**

So what do you get inside the box? Here's what everything looks like, still in minty fresh shrink-wrap:

![][42]

A complete listing of all components:

**Components needed for both games:**   
● 1 Board of England &amp; Wales  
● 1 Rule book  
● 6 Reference cards

**Components needed only for Railways of England: Basic Railways of the World Expansion**  
● Railroad Baron cards  
● Railroad Operations cards

![][43]

![][44]

**Components needed only for Railways of England: Advanced Share System**  
● Shares  
● Shares Issued box  
● Available Shares box  
● Share markers  
● Company tiles  
● Share price track

![][45]

![][46]

![][47]

If you add in the components from the base game, Railroad Tycoon (which I'll refer to in the rest of the review using the name of the re-implemented version, Railways of the World), it looks something like this:

![][48]

**Rule Book**

The rule book matches the artwork on the box cover.

![][49]

Including the front and rear cover, it is a grand total of 8 pages, of which only five pages consist of text about the rules.

**Basic Railways of the World Expansion**

Since the basic gameplay hasn't changed from Railways of the World, only the modifications and changes to the basic rules are included – essentially the same changes already introduced with Rails of Europe. This takes up barely a page of text, and is very straight forward.

**Advanced Share System**

Three and a half pages of text (with few illustrations) are devoted to explaining the Advanced rules. Introducing a share system into the game changes it completely, effectively making it a whole new game. A new game? Really? Don't take my word for it, here's what others have had to say about this:

"_Calling them 'Advanced Rules' is a misnomer that hurts in learning them. They are not an 'advancement' on the previous rule-set, but a completely new style of play. You pretty much put most of the components (all of the cards, Train Types, tycoon cards) back in the box and start from scratch. The new rules turn it into an 18xx-ultralite. The game is fantastic, and it will be hard to play with the regular rules again._" - Rob Leveille

"_The advanced rules change up the gameplay quite a bit. The game becomes a stock buying and investing game (players do not own companies, they buy shares in them to make money) No engines are used, so deliveries can be as long as the track you build! Companies can merge with other companies, making for huge lines and big delivery $$ The game has a great catch - up mechanic. If someone is running away with the game, invest in the companies he/she is, and watch your profits rise. I have seen games were the person who won did not control a single railroad - he only invested in the money making ones, and it paid off to diversify his stocks._" - Sean Brown

It's clear that the advanced game was intended to be a very different sort of game from Railroad Tycoon, despite using some of the same components.

**Map**

In my opinion the map is the best one yet in the Railways of the World series.

![][50]

A big thumbs up for the beautiful board! Here's a close-up of the artwork:

![][51]

The surface is less reflective than the Rails of Europe expansion map, and so creates less glare, and somehow it seems to be better quality. Size wise, it is the same dimensions as the Europe map, but rotated 90 degrees.

![][52]

It's certainly smaller than the original Railroad Tycoon map, making it easier to find a large enough surface on which to play the game.

![][53]

Critics of previous editions will be pleased to know that the purple and blue cities are quite distinct from each other. It's good to know that this is no longer a production issue, although the difference in colours could still present problems for those who are mildly colour-blind.

![][54]

There map also includes a scoring track around the board, and spaces for keeping track of Turn Order and Round.

![][55]

**What do I think?**

Considered only as an expansion to the Railways of the World system, Railways of England and Wales is already excellent in its own right. The map offers a different feel than Rails of Europe, and I prefer playing with maps and improved rules offered by these expansions than the original. But by adding in a completely new Martin Wallace train game as a bonus, Railways of England and Wales becomes a very attractive product indeed. Certainly the Martin Wallace fan now has lots of options.

If you're looking for a **medium-weight** Wallace train game, you can choose between:  
2009 [Railways of the World][3] (aka, the new and improved [Railroad Tycoon][3]) with its expansions [Railways of Europe][34] and [Railways of England and Wales][7]; or  
2009 [Steam][16] Basic.   
But if you're looking for a **heavy-weight** Wallace train game, you can choose between:  
2002 [Age of Steam][23]  
2009 [Steam][16] Standard (and for heavier play the expansion [Steam Barons][32]); or  
2009 [Railways of England and Wales][7] Advanced Share System

For many gamers, [Steam][16] may have seemed to be the most sensible choice, since it offers a heavy weight Age of Steam style game (Steam Standard), along with a medium weight game (Steam Basic) thrown in as a bonus. But now [Railways of the World][3] paired with the [Railways of England and Wales][7] expansion becomes an attractive option too, because it offers a medium weight Railroad Tycoon style game (at the high point of its evolutionary development), along with an entirely new heavy weight game (Railways of England: Advanced Share System) thrown in as a bonus! The Advanced Share System rules that come with Railways of England make the series go in a different direction, and it will be interesting to see where gamers will end up when they embark on this new train!

**The final word**

Obviously I'm not done yet, because I've only reviewed the components, development, and history of the game, and not the game-play. But hopefully this gives you a helpful overview of what you get when you buy [Railways of England and Wales][7], what to expect from it, and the broader context of the game. Because we've got two separate games in this box, I intend to post two separate reviews for that, rather than one massive review which confuses the two. They're two distinct games, and deserve separate treatment.

But already it can be said that this game is a pretty good deal, because you effectively get two games for the price of one: a great expansion map for Railways of the World (aka Railroad Tycoon Mark II), AND a light 18xx type game. I like my theme, and I like my Martin Wallace, so both games definitely deserve a closer look!
