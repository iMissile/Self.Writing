# Ender's Comprehensive Pictorial Overview: The next big thing from Japan since Love Letter | Machi Koro

![][1]

**Introducing Machi Koro**  

![][2]

  
Europe, and Germany in particular, is usually considered to be the stronghold of modern games. It's where many euro games originate - after all, why else do we call them euros? It's in Europe that the biggest game fair in the world takes place every year in Essen. And it's also where most influential award in the gaming industry, the Spiel des Jahres, is awarded on an annual basis.

In recent years, however, some surprisingly excellent and popular games have been emerging from a rather unlikely source: Japan. Just consider [Love Letter][3], which was arguably the most purchased and most played game of boardgamegeek users last year. The company that deserves the credit for first bringing Love Letter to the worldwide stage is Japon Brand, a private distributor of Japanese games that helps distribute and promote games created by independent Japanese designers and publishers.

After the phenomenal success of Love Letter, we can again look to Japon Brand for bringing us what is potentially another huge blockbuster: [**Machi Koro][4]**, designed by Masao Suganuma. The name Machi Koro is Japanese for "City Dice" or "Town Roll", which represents the fact that in the game you're building a town/city by rolling dice. Japon Brand brought the game to Spiel 2013 where it proved to be a big hit. English copies were available in limited supply at Essen, and were quickly snapped up as Machi Koro became an instant darling for the many gamers who tried it.

The next step was to get the game licensed for a mass market publication in English. Those desperate to get their hands on this little gem will be pleased to know that IDW Games and Pandasaurus Games are teaming up to produce the game and bring it to an English-speaking audience coming July. The Japanese expansion is already a big success, and is planned for an English release towards the end of this year.

So why all the love? Quite simply, because this is a very clever game that offers a lot in a small package. The package here is bigger than Love Letter, with more cards (108) and a longer playing time (15-30 minutes), but it offers immediate gratification for hungry gamers looking for a bite sized chunks of gaming goodness to consume, and almost certainly leaves them with a growing appetite for more. In the game, players purchase building cards from a Dominion like tableau, and then roll dice in a Settlers of Catan like manner to produce the income that will enable them to buy more buildings. It's a simple concept that just works, and leaves you wondering: why didn't someone think of this earlier? So let's find out more about this newest star heading to English shores from Japan.

![][5]

  
_Ready to begin a two player game_

**COMPONENTS**

**Game box**

I was fortunate to receive a pre-release copy from one of the publishers, Pandasaurus Games, so what you see pictured in this review are components that are quite close to the final product. The text on the cards shown below is almost final and any further changes will be very minimal, although the final published version of the game will include punch-out cardboard coins that are a definite improvement on what was provided with my copy. The box pictured here is the one from the original Japanese publisher, Grounding Inc, hence the absence of any English wording on the front cover.

Pictured on the front of the box are various elements of a city. As the rulebook will explain, "_You are the owner of a large company. The goal of the game is to develop your town, so that you can build all of the major landmarks before your rivals do._" The artwork on the box cover features a colourful and charming style that corresponds to what is found on the cards. Fortunately the English publishers have made a sensible choice to retain this stylish artwork throughout the game!

![][6]

The back of the box shows some of the cards and introduces us to the basic concepts of the game. Again, what you see here is from the Japanese edition, so expect all this to be in English when the game comes out in July. One thing you can figure out is that the game is suitable for 2-4 players, that it takes about 30 minutes, and is recommended for ages 7 and up.

![][7]

**Component list**

Inside the box you'll find:  
● 108 cards  
● 60 coins  
● 2 dice  
● rulebook

![][8]

**Establishment cards**

The bulk of the cards in the game represent "establishments". In layman's terms these are simply: buildings. These represent the cards you'll be buying from the supply to improve your city, and will be placed face-up on the table Dominion style, and available for purchase by all players. Pictured below is an example of an establishment: a "Wheat Field". I'll show you the English version of all the cards in just a moment, but for now this picture will help you understand the layout of the cards in the game.

![][9]

In the _middle_ of the card is the _name_ and _picture_ of the card - the pictures, by the way, are delightfully charming, and feature a style that represents quite a pleasant departure from what we usually see in euro games.   
At the _bottom left_ is the _cost_ of the card - something we'll figure out very quickly if we've ever played Dominion.   
Also on the _bottom_ of the card is the _ability_ of the card in question, which in the case of Wheat Field is "_Get 1 coin from the bank, on anyone's turn_". Nearly all the card abilities relate to getting money in one fashion or another.   
But perhaps most important, at the _top_ of the card is a _number_, and that indicates on _ what die roll that card is activated_. For example, the Convenience Store has a 4 on the top, and that means you'll get to trigger its effect ("Get 3 coins from the bank, on your turn only") when you roll a four. Other cards, like the Wheat Field shown here, give you income even if other players roll the number in question, a mechanic that we'll quickly feel at home with if we've ever played Settlers of Catan.

So let's show you some of the different types of establishments in the game. There are 15 altogether, with all the numbers that can be rolled with 1 or 2 dice (i.e. from 1 through 12) represented in one way or another. Establishments are come in one of four different colours, with cards of each colour working in a similar manner.

**● Blue** (Primary Industry)

The five different blue cards (**Wheat Field, Ranch, Forest, Mine, Apple Orchard**) all generate income when the number on top (1,2,5,9,10) is rolled on anybody's turn.

![][10]

**● Green** (Shops/Factories/Markets)

The five different green cards (**Bakery, Convenience Store, Cheese Factory, Furniture Factory, Fruit and Vegetable Market**) all generate potentially larger amounts of income than the blue cards, but only when you roll the numbers on top (2-3,4,7,8,11-12) on your _own_ turn. Three of these buildings combo with other cards, and the amount you earn is dependent on cards with other icons. For example, the Furniture Factory is activated if you roll an 8, and gives you 3 coins for each building you own with a cog symbol (Forest or Mine).

![][11]

**● Red** (Restaurants)

The two different red cards (**Cafe, Family Restaurant**) generate income when _other players_ roll the number on top (3,9-10). These help ensure a measure of interaction.

![][12]

**● Purple** (Major Establishments)

The three different purple cards (**Stadium, TV Station, Business Center**) are the most expensive buildings in the game, with costs ranging from 6-8 coins. They're all activated by rolling a 6 on your turn, but give you good potential to interfere with your opponents by stealing their money or even their buildings. Because they are quite strong, players may only build one of each, whereas other buildings can be built in multiple amounts. For this reason while there are six of each other establishment in the game, there are only four of each of the major establishments.

![][13]

**_Starting cards_**

At the start of the game, each player begins with a Wheat Field and a Bakery. These are extra cards in addition to the six copies of all the regular buildings, and are marked with a different colour (yellow) on the card backs. The artwork on the back of the cards, it should be said, is absolutely charming!

![][14]

**Landmark cards**

The aim of the game is to be the first player to build four "Landmarks", which work in a similar fashion to the Establishments.

![][15]

There are four different Landmarks, and can be built in any order: a **Station** (cost 4), **Shopping Mall** (cost 10), **Amusement Park** (cost 16), **Radio Tower** (cost 22). As you can see, these are considerably more expensive than regular buildings, so you'll need to build up somewhat of a money-producing economy first, with the help of other buildings. Just like Establishments, the Landmarks also give you a benefit when you build them, such as being able to roll two dice instead of just one, being able to re-roll your dice, or increasing the income produced by restaurants or some green buildings.

![][16]

**Coins**

Pictured here are the tiddly-wink style plastic counters that double as currency in the pre-release copy of the game that I received. Fear not, the published game will have much more attractive and functional punchout chits, in denominations of 10, 5 and 1.

![][17]

**Dice**

The published game will come with two standard D6s; pictured here are two dice I temporarily re-purposed from another game in order to play.

![][18]

**Rulebook**

You can download the English rulebook that was released by the Japanese publisher Grounding Inc for the Essen 2013 release:

[English rule of Machi Koro][19]

It consists of a single folded page made out of thin double-sided card. Yes, the rules really are that simple! You can learn the rules in no time. The one or two minor questions that have arisen since the English release last year (e.g. how many [`six' buildings][20] a player can build) will all be cleared up in the final rules.

![][21]

**GAME-PLAY**

**Set-up**

Similar to Dominion, all fifteen establishment card are placed in face-up piles, where they will be available to all players to be purchased. It's easiest to just arrange these in order of the value of the dice rolls, from 1 through 12.

![][22]

  
_Establishments available for purchase_

The money is also placed in the middle as a central supply, and each player begins with 3 coins, as well as one Wheat Field and one Bakery, along with their four yet-to-be constructed Landmarks.

![][23]

  
_A player's starting city_

**Flow of Play**

In clockwise order, players will take a turn doing the following:  
1\. Rolling dice &amp; activating buildings  
2\. Building an establishment/landmark

**1\. Roll dice &amp; activate buildings**

The first thing you do on your turn is roll the dice (only one die, unless you've built the Station which lets you optionally roll two dice). Any of your existing buildings that match the number of your roll are then activated. Green and purple buildings are activated and produce income only on your own turn e.g. rolling a 4 activates any Convenience Stores you have built, and lets you take 3 coins from the bank for each of these. Blue buildings are activated and produce income on anyone's turn, just like in Settlers of Catan. Red buildings are activated on your opponent's turn, e.g. if you own two Cafes and your opponent rolls a 3, then he must pay you 1 coin for each of your Cafes.

![][24]

  
_Rolling a two gives all players income from their Ranches_

Sometimes a roll requires you to pay your opponent and earn income (e.g. a 3 triggers your opponent's Cafe as well as your own Bakery). Payment is processed before getting income, and if you don't have enough money to pay an opponent, that's tough luck for him. Similarly if you have to pay multiple opponents, these are resolved in counter-clockwise order.

**2\. Build an establishment/landmark**

After making any payments and getting any income triggered by your roll, you can build one new establishment or landmark. You simply pay the cost on the bottom left of the card, and then take one from the general supply and add it to your personal city (or in the case of a landmark: turn it face-up). You can have multiple copies of the same establishment, except for the Major Establishments (purple), of which you can only build one of each. Abilities of any newly purchased building are immediately available from that point on.

![][25]

  
_A three player game in progress _

**Game End**

As soon as one player has built all four of his landmarks, he's won the game, and the game is immediately over.

**CONCLUSIONS**

**What games does Machi Koro remind me of?**

There's no game that compares exactly with Machi Koro, because it really is quite unique. But it does have some mechanics that invite comparisons with other games, and even make you ask: why didn't somebody think of this earlier?

[**_The Settlers of Catan][27]_**:  
**What's similar**: The fact that you roll dice on your turn while other players can earn resources/money depending on what you roll, and that you need to play the odds to help decide what to build.  
**What's different**: There's no board or spatial element, no trading, and buildings are cards which are bought with a single currency rather than with multiple resources.

[**_Dominion][28]_**:  
**What's similar**: The fact that there's a market of cards available for all players to purchase from, which are purchased with money that is generated by your buildings/cards.  
**What's different**: There's no deck-building whatsoever, and cards purchased are immediately built and permanently available for the rest of the game.

![][29]

![][30]

**What do I think?**  

![][31]

  
**Engine-builder**. Really what you're doing is building up somewhat of an engine. There's only one resource - money - so you're trying to build more buildings that will produce even more money, and eventually enough so that you can buy the four landmarks that win you the game. So it starts slowly, but eventually you get yourself set, where you can even be earning 24 or 36 coins on a turn. Have I mentioned the word fun yet?

**Dice-rolling = randomness**. Yes, Machi Koro has a luck-element. What else were you expecting in a dice game anyway? You can build multiple Furniture Factories hoping to roll and 8, and not see an 8. On the other hand your opponent might luck out and be able to use his Fruit &amp; Vegetable Stands with an 11 or 12 two turns in a row. Such things happen, but haven't we already learned that by playing Settlers of Catan?

**Dice-rolling = excitement**. The randomness also adds tension to the game. While it can be a little frustrating at times, it's precisely the random element that makes the game so compelling and gripping. You hold your breath and roll those dice, desperately hoping for an 8! The game just wouldn't be any fun if the results were too predictable. While sometimes you might feel like cursing your bad rolling, it's precisely the dice that make you keep coming back to this game, because the thrill of the chase is hard to deny. Machi Koro has somewhat of a gambling feel - your hopes are riding on a few numbers, and even if they don't come up, you always feel as if you're in with a chance, if only things rolled your way. The dice-rolling here has an exciting feel that is a way that is present in few other games.

**Dice-rolling = statistical probability**. While there is randomness, it's not totally random. By that I mean: the randomness still follows some kind of a pattern over the long term. We all know how basic knowledge of probability can help us know where to place our bets. Again, if Settlers of Catan taught us anything, it's that building on an 8 is much better than building on a 12, because it gives us a much better chance of seeing our number rolled. You'll use this knowledge in Machi Koro too. The Cheese Factories, for example, activate on a 7, and we all know that a 7 has the greatest chance of being rolled, whereas a 10 is less likely. It's now up to you to use this knowledge wisely, in deciding what to build, and try to develop a town which is more likely to see the dice roll your way. A basic knowledge of probability/statistics certainly will help you make good choices here.

**Randomness doesn't have the only say**. Just because there's some randomness, doesn't mean that Machi Koro develops into a pure luck fest. Not at all, because not only can you work with basic probability to increase your chances of success, but you can also build establishments that combo together; a more risky strategy but one with potentially greater rewards. Do you gamble all your money on a building of one type and hope to get that lucky roll for a quick win, or do you spread your bets for a more steady accumulation of income?  

![][32]

  
**Choices**. What this means is that we do have choices when playing Machi Koro. Do I get something small to keep my income going? Or do I save money so I can buy something more valuable, but at the risk of someone stealing my money before I get a chance to spend it? Do I buy more of what I have and hope for a lucky roll, or do I diversify my holdings to guarantee more modest returns? Do I try to pin all my hopes on a game winning combo? Speaking of which...

**Combos**. For example, there's the the Ranch and Cheese Factory combo, which relies on rolling 7s, with each Cheese Factory giving you three coins for each of your Ranches - potentially very lucrative! Or you can go for Fruit and Vegetable Stands, which are cheaper to build, and reward you for your Wheat Fields, but are statistically less likely to be rolled. Another combo is to build Forests and Mines, and then a Furniture Factory to generate masses of money, but of course if you don't roll an 8, your Furniture Factory won't earn you anything! Yet another good strategy is to go for a Shopping Mall, making your Bakeries and Cafes producing double the amount and potentially hurting your opponents too. Part of the thrill is having these exciting kinds of combos come off when you roll just the number you need.

**Quick**. Despite all the cards, the game only takes a few minutes to set-up. What's more, most games of Machi Koro only take 15-20 minutes to play. Once you're familiar with the game, you can bang out a two player game in little more than 10 minutes or so. Considering the fun that's packed into that time-frame, that's quite an accomplishment. Getting burned by lady luck after a two hour game is annoying, but if it happens in this game, you'll just want to play again right away, all the more determined to try your strategy again in the hope you might win on your next game!

**Light**. Machi Koro isn't a deep game where you can develop complicated strategies. It's a dice-rolling game after all, so there's a definite luck element. It also plays in only 15-20 minutes or so. And in the end there's really just one resource: money. So don't come in expecting a long or deeply strategic experience. This isn't a weakness of the game, any more than it would be a weakness to describe Usain Bolt as having a more lean frame than an Olympic heavy weight-lifter.

**Judge on its merits**. It also wouldn't be fair to criticize Machi Koro for not doing things that it's not trying to do in the first place; that would be like criticizing a tennis ball for its unsuitability for the Olympic shot put. Machi Koro isn't a shot put event for heavy-weights, nor is it trying to be; it's a tennis ball that can bounce all over the place, sometimes in surprising ways, and it's light, active, and fun. Yes there's randomness, yes there's luck in dice-rolling, yes the strategy isn't deep, but in the end this is a light dice game, and when judged as such, it's a very good one, and does a terrific job for the niche that it's trying to fill. It wouldn't be fair to compare it to Through the Ages or Agricola, but when compared with games of a similar weight, it compares very favourably!  

![][33]

  
**Good family game**. Given its light weight, and the excitement and punch that it packs into the short time frame and simple rules, Machi Koro is an ideal candidate for a quick family game, or even as a choice to introduce to non-gamers. It fills a similar kind of niche as games like Augustus. If Augustus was a gamer bingo, then this is a gamer dice rolling filler. Almost everybody's collection has room for a game that is easy to explain to non-gamers, and yet is something that they themselves can enjoy as gamers too, and Machi Koro is exactly that kind of game.

**You're involved on other player's turns**. Another things we've learned from Settlers of Catan, is the value of games where you get to do stuff on other player's turns. The Settlers of Catan mechanic where the dice roll on your turn can potentially generate resources for me is present here, and it helps keep the game interesting and fun.

**Interaction**: Interaction happens in other ways too. For example, the purple buildings that are activated on a 6, give players the option of stealing money and even cards from your opponents - but they require a significant investment to build, so they won't always come into play. Owning the Cafe and Restaurant can also force your opponents to pay you money if they roll a certain number on their turn. For the most part this game is still a race where you're building up your own engine, but there's enough interaction to ensure it never feels like multiplayer solitaire.

**Begging for expansion**: As elegant and streamlined and fun as Machi Koro is, it's also begging for an expansion. The game comes with 12 buildings, and certainly that gives room for many different plays, trying different combos and using different buildings. But imagine Dominion first was released with just 10 kingdom cards instead of 25. That is somewhat what Machi Koro feels like. And because we know how Dominion's replayability is enhanced by a larger set of cards, Machi Koro feels like it's just crying out to have some more buildings and possibilities injected to make the experience even more rich and replayable. Fortunately an expansion for the game does exist ([Machi Koro: Harbor Expansion][34]), and should be coming to the US by the end of the year. An expansion does seem essential to ensure the game's long-term longevity, although it's certainly very fun, complete, and worthwhile, without an expansion - I've played it over 20 times already and am long not sick of it.

**Charming artwork**: The Japanese roots of Machi Koro are partly evident in the artwork, which features as style that isn't at all what we're used to from typical euros. It's cute, bright, and really adds to the game's charm and unique feel. Fortunately the US publisher was smart enough not to try to change it for the wider English release.

**What do others think?**

**The criticism**

Not everyone thinks that Machi Koro is the bees knees. So what kind of criticisms might you expect to hear from people who didn't enjoy the game? If you scan the negative comments, a few things emerge as reasons why some folks didn't like the game:

1\. _It has potential for a runaway leader caused by a snowball effect_. _Response:_ This is definitely a factor in the game, and the whole point of Machi Koro is to build an engine that gathers more and more momentum. If you get ahead early, it can be hard for others to catch up. But in defence of the game, there's still always the chance of some lucky rolls, and while there's no real catch-up mechanism, for a light and quick filler game, this isn't a fatal weakness; the snowball effect is part of the appeal of the game, and what it's all about!

2\. _It needs more cards_. _Response:_ This isn't really a criticism of the game as such, but is more of an argument in favour of adding an expansion to the game. And this is not really something I'd disagree with. The game is fine as is, but for long term replay viability, more cards will be needed. Similar criticisms were made about Arctic Scavengers, which in its second edition was released with several expansion modules included with the base game, and perhaps that's what eventually needs to happen with Machi Koro too.

3\. _It has too much luck_. _Response:_ This is going to be a matter of opinion and taste. I think it's just right for a light and quick filler, but I can appreciate that for people who don't like too much randomness in their games, this might kill the experience for them. If you're looking for depth, this is not a game for you. If you're looking for a fun filler that has a good ratio of time vs decisions vs fun, don't rule it out too quickly.

4\. _It has some confrontational take-that elements_. _Response:_ It's true that sometimes others can have cards that let them steal stuff from you if the dice roll their way. But the reality is that they need to invest money into this strategy, and it won't always reward them. Furthermore, without this element, there would be virtually no interaction at all. So I think the game gets the balance just right - there's the potential for sharp interaction if you want it, but you have to pay for it, and it's a risk, and having this option available to you ensures potential for some interaction, without it ever becoming a main strategy.

** The praise**  

![][36]

  
Those who like the game often say they enjoy it far more than they should, so clearly Machi Koro has something magnetic about its game mechanisms that keeps people returning to it. Here's some of the gushing praise for the game:

"Brilliant little filler, instantly addictive and leaves you hungry for more. Some tactics and strategies to explore too." - Doug Adams  
"WOW! What a game. Sometimes at Essen there is ... an unstoppable gaming phenomena which takes the world by storm (think Love Letter). I would not be in any way surprised if Machi Koro follows this path. It is a gem." - Peter D  
"Settlers meets Dominion meets probability. Addictive and engaging dice builder." - Paul Lister  
"Great lovely artwork, nice, easy and engaging game play. Awesome!" - r.a.vinck  
"Was a really solid filler. I am normally not a huge fan of dice, but they are implemented well here. It does feel like you are building a miniature city." - Mitchell Waldbauer  
"Gorgeous candy-like art. Simple, immersive gameplay. I love." - William Ang  
"With 100% player engagement, no downtime, highly interactive strategic play, this may be the best filler game I've ever played." - Starla Lester  
"Nice fun, light game with adorable artwork." - Arthur Cormode  
"Fantastic game." - Chris Darden  
"Simple concept, and works real well. My kind of game: clever, fast, simple, fun. Very easy to play. Lovely. Not much strategic depth, I think, but some decision-making anyway." - Mikko Saari  
"Fun combination of card and dice game - I don't really like dice games, but Machi Koro made the cut." - Hilko Drude  
"Together with Blueprints, the best filler dice game of Essen 2013 IMO." - Robert Lautenbach  
"Good game for a pack of cards. Obviously largely a luck game - but fun." - A. Pettingale  
"This is a great filler. I found that it offers some hard choices and needs really good timing in order to maximize your dice roll's potential." - Dimitris Varrias  
"Fun atmosphere and simple, luck-driven gameplay that offers a lot for anyone looking for a quick game." - Jason D. Kingsley  
"Money Engine - The Card Game. A Blast! Very Cute Art! City building card game with no hand management. Easy to learn, play, and teach." - Peter Elsenheimer  
"Tremendously fun filler." - M.J.E. Hendriks  
"This game is more fun than it should be." - Mike B  
"Currently I will NOT refuse any suggestion to play this fantastic filler. Just wonderful." - Anthony Boydell

**Recommendation**  

![][38]

  
That's a lot of nice things to say about [**Machi Koro][4]**, isn't it? But this game really does deserve it! I really can't think of anything bad to say about it, except that "I want more". Which means: bring on the expansion! Yes, the light feel and random elements will mean that not everyone will appreciate it, and some will find it too light. But hey, not everyone likes tennis, and some people prefer the shot put. But for me, Machi Koro gets the mix just right; it makes for a superb filler style game, with just enough decision making in a short time frame to feel just right.

There are choices to be made: do you play a low risk strategy by slowly building up resources with diverse buildings to increase chances of getting money, or do you put all your eggs in one basket hoping for that one lucky roll that will give you an instant windfall? Can you get buildings that combo together to increase your revenue even more, or should you opt for buildings that let you steal stuff from your opponents?

All in all, there's enough decisions to make this a game that you want to keep coming back to. But perhaps most of all, it's fun to play, and makes dice rolling exciting. Even those who don't normally like dice games concede that Machi Koro has an appeal that they find hard to resist. I highly recommend this title, and especially when paired with its forthcoming expansion, expect it to be one of the big successes of 2014. Highly recommended!
