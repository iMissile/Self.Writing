# Ender's Comprehensive Pictorial Overview: Another Spiel des Jahres award winner from the designer of Dominion | Kingdom Builder

![][1]

**Introducing Kingdom Builder**  

![][2]

  
[**Kingdom Builder][3]** is easily the most played game in our household over the last month. Yes, I know that I'm somewhat late to the party, because this game has been out for well over a year already. But a party it certainly is - Kingdom Builder has already won numerous prestigious awards, most notably the 2012 Spiel des Jahres award. Although the credibility of the Spiele des Jahres has been under fire in recent years, awards like our very own 2012 Golden Geek Award for Best Abstract Game confirm that the recognition of Kingdom Builder was no mistake. And well deserved these awards are too. After the immense success of his 2008 hit [Dominion][4], winner of the the 2009 Spiel des Jahres award, designer Donald X. Vaccarino has come up with another clever design that features randomized elements to ensure strong replayability and changing gameplay from game to game, combined with a short play time and simple rules that appeal readily to gamers and non-gamers alike. So let's find out what Kingdom Builder is like, and discover what the fuss is all about!

![][5]

  
_A two player game in progress_

**COMPONENTS**

**Game box**

The game box is a nice large box from Queen Games, essentially matching the size of Dominion and its descendants. The cover title and artwork hold the promise of a castles and kingdoms, but just as with Dominion, the theme is quite thin and pasted on, because it's the game-play that proves to be the real draw-card here rather than the theme.

![][6]

On the reverse side is an overview of the basic idea of the game: "_By skillful building of settlements players create their own kingdoms, aiming to earn the most gold at the end of the game. Who will have the post powerful kingdom at the end of the game?_" There's also a picture of the game in play, and don't miss this apt tag-line: "_1 game - 1000 ways to play_."

![][7]

**Component list**

So what do you get inside? Not surprisingly, since this is published by Queen Games, we get some very attractive components:

● 8 double-sided game boards  
● 160 settlements (40 in each player colour)  
● 4 scoring markers  
● 25 terrain cards  
● 10 kingdom builder cards  
● 28 location tiles  
● 8 location tile summary cards  
● start player tile  
● instructions

![][8]

  
_Everything you get with the game_

**Game boards**

The game comes with 8 double-sided game boards made of thick sturdy cardboard. Each of the boards features a landscape of 100 hexes, with a different configuration of terrain types, namely grass, flower fields, forest, canyon, desert, mountains, and water. In each game, you'll be using a random selection of four of these, placed together to make a game board, and the beautiful aspect of this is that nearly every game will be different. The randomization is further enhanced by the special abilities of each board, because in addition to the regular terrain there are two other special hexes: castles and location hexes. Building adjacent to the location hexes will also give players a unique location tile that provides special abilities that we'll explain later. Building adjacent to the castle hexes will earn extra points at the game end.

![][9]

The reverse side of each game board can be used as a score track.

![][10]

**Settlements**

There are 40 wooden settlement tokens in each of the four player colours. You'll be placing these on the board in order to meet the objectives of a game and thus score points; most of the game-play is about placing these tokens on the board.

![][11]

  
_Settlement tokens in four colours_

**Scoring markers**

Each player also gets a scoring marker in their colour, which will be used to track their gold (= points) on the score track. Scoring only happens at the very end of the game.

![][12]

  
_Scoring markers in four colours_

**Terrain cards**

A small deck of 25 terrain cards will drive placement of the settlements. Players have one card in hand each turn, and can place three settlements on the terrain pictured on the card, which correspond to one of the five legal terrain types for normal placement: grass, flower field, forest, canyon, and desert. The cards aren't the most sturdy, but they are certainly attractive.

![][13]

  
_Grass, Flower Field, Forest, Canyon, and Desert terrain cards_

**Kingdom Builder cards**

There are also 10 Kingdom Builder cards: Fishermen, Merchants, Discoverers, Hermits, Citizens, Miners, Workers, Knights, Lords, and Farmers. Each game three of these will be selected randomly at the start of the game. These list the different objectives for that particular game, and effectively set forth the victory conditions for earning points. For example, the Hermit gives 1 gold for each separate settlement you have, while Miners give 1 gold for each of your settlements next to a mountain hex, and Discoverers give 1 gold for each horizontal line on the gameboard containing one of your settlements.

Here's the complete list of all the Kingdom Builder cards, with a brief description of how each generates gold (= points):

**Citizens** \- Create a large settlement area  
**Hermits** \- Create many settlement areas  
**Lords** \- Build the most settlements in each sector

![][14]

**Farmers** \- Build settlements in all sectors  
**Merchants** \- Connect location and castle hexes  
**Workers** \- Build settlements next to location or castle hexes

![][15]

**Discoverers** \- Build settlements on many horizontal lines  
**Knights** \- Build many settlements on one horizontal line

![][16]

**Fishermen** \- Build settlements on the waterfront  
**Miners** \- Build settlements next to a mountain

![][17]

It's not hard to see that a mix of different kingdom builder cards will radically change what you're trying to accomplish in placing your settlements from game to game. They are arguably the heart of Kingdom Builder, by determining the goals for each game, and ensuring strong replayability.

**Location tiles**

Each board has at least one special location hex that enables players to claim location tiles by placing a settlement adjacent to that hex. They are unique to each of the 8 boards, and are as follows: oracle, farm, tavern, tower, harbor, paddock, barn, and oasis. For example, if you manage to get a farm location tile, that will enable you to build an extra settlement on a grass hex each turn, in addition to the three settlements you are required to place that turn. These location tiles keep things varied as well, and either allow you to add an additional settlement on your turn, or move an existing one. They will often prove tremendously useful to help you achieve the conditions set by the kingdom builder cards. We'll explain their abilities in more detail later in the review.

![][18]

**Location tile summary cards**

While the reverse side of the location tiles has a summary of their abilities using icons, there are also larger tiles that summarize their unique abilities, which can be placed alongside the board during play to help players remember what the available location tiles can be used for.

![][19]

**Start player token**

This sturdy cardboard token is used to keep track of the starting player, since all players will need to receive an equal number of turns.

![][20]

**Instructions**

The instructions are exactly what we've come to expect from Queen Games - a well-organized colourful 6 page spread with lots of examples, making the game a breeze to learn.

You can download the rules here on BGG: [Kingdom Builder English Rules][21]

![][22]

  
_Sample spread from rulebook_

**GAME-PLAY**

**Set-up**

Randomly select three of the ten kingdom builder cards, and place them face up. These will determine the scoring conditions for this particular game, so you won't need the other seven kingdom builder cards. Take note of these three cards carefully, because they will set your objectives and determine how you go about placing your settlements!

![][23]

  
_Selecting objective cards at game set-up _

Choose four of the game boards and set them up into a single game board - orientation doesn't matter. Each board will have a unique location tile - place the tiles on the appropriate hexes, and their matching summary tiles beside the boards. Each player gets 1 starting terrain card in hand from a shuffled deck, along with 40 settlements and a scoring token in their colour. Let's play!

![][24]

  
_A complete two player set-up_

**Flow of Play**

_**Building settlements**_

In turns, players play their terrain card, and must place _three_ (3) of their settlements on the board on empty hexes of that terrain.

![][25]

  
_This terrain card requires placing three settlements on Grass hexes_

As you're doing this, you'll want to keep the three chosen kingdom builder cards in mind, because that will determine the best place to build your settlements. But there is one important catch: you must place your settlements _adjacent_ to one of your existing settlements if you can. At the end of your turn, you draw a new terrain card to replace the one you've used and discarded, and then it's the next player's turn.

![][26]

  
_The orange player places three adjacent settlements in flower fields_

_**Using location tiles**_

If you build next to a location hex, you can claim that location tile, and begin using its ability on future turns. Basically this gives you an extra special action that you can use once per turn (flip the tile over to keep track of whether or not you've used it). The special action can be used at any point during your turn, and lets you do things like building an extra settlement at the edge of the game board (Tavern), or moving an existing settlement to a water hex (Harbor). Regular building rules still apply, i.e. you must build adjacent to one of your existing settlements if you can. Here's the complete list:

**Oracle** \- Build an extra settlement on a hex of the same terrain type as your played terrain card.  
**Tower** \- Build an extra settlement on the edge of the game board  
**Oasis** \- Build an extra settlement on a desert hex.  
**Farm** \- Build an extra settlement on a grass hex.  
**Harbor** \- Move one of your settlements to a water hex.  
**Paddock** \- Move one of your settlements two hexes away in a straight line.  
**Barn** \- Move one of your settlements to a hex of the same terrain type as your played terrain card.  
**Tavern** \- Build an extra settlement at the end of a line of at least three of your settlements.

![][27]

  
_Helpful iconography on the reverse side of all eight location tiles_

Figuring out ways to maximize the benefits of these location tiles is one of the keys to playing Kingdom Builder well.

**Scoring**

When one player has built their last settlement, the round is completed so that everyone has an equal number of turns, and you move to final scoring. Points are awarded as follows:

● 3 gold for each castle hex that you have a settlement adjacent to  
● gold as earned by each of the three kingdom builder cards

![][28]

  
_Scoring example: calculating points for Miners_

The player with the most gold/points is the winner! And that's the game! Very straight forward!

**CONCLUSIONS**

**What do I think?**  

![][29]

  
**Components: _very attractive_**. Kingdom Builder is a well-produced game, and has attractive components that give it immediate appeal, especially for first-time players and even for non-gamers among your family and friends. I especially appreciate the artwork on the cards. Queen Games rarely disappoints with its components, and this game is no exception.

**Theme: _quite abstract_**. There is some theme, but it is largely window dressing that plays a serving role to the puzzle-like tactical game-play. This game is more about tactics and strategy than it is about theme, so don't come in expecting much in the way of thematic chrome. Fortunately its relative absence doesn't really matter given the strength of the game-play.

**Length: _about 45 minutes_**. Most games can be completed well within the hour, and often considerably quicker, making Kingdom Builder ideally suited for introducing to friends and family, or even playing a couple of games back to back as a couple. Because players draw a new terrain card at the end of their turn, they can plan ahead for their next turn, and although occasionally your plans may need to be adjusted based on what other players do, for the most part there's very little down time. The limitations on settlement placement also helps keep AP to a minimum. The depth of gameplay feels just right given how quickly you can play the game, which is faster than your average euro or gateway game.

**Complexity: _light-medium_**. The rules are very straight forward and easy to learn, and the rulebook does a good job of explaining them with numerous examples. The summary cards for the location tiles also prove to be very helpful in this regard. Kingdom Builder is not at all a difficult game to learn, and the fun to be had lies in enjoying the possible combinations and possibilities afforded by the cards and tiles, rather than in figuring out complex layers of chrome or obscure rules as is the case with some games.

**Strategy: _light-medium_**. Players draw only one terrain card and are limited to playing on that terrain only, and furthermore are restricted to building adjacent to existing settlements. These are very real and significant constraints that have led many gamers to conclude that Kingdom Builder lacks meaningful decisions. Without these constraints, however, the game would too readily bog down with analysis paralysis, and so these limitations have the advantage of keeping the game moving briskly and quickly. And while poor luck can occasionally way-lay your plans, and the game is more on the lighter side than your average euro, it would be a mistake to think that is luck driven. The random card draw forces players to be flexible, and to keep their options open rather than putting all their eggs in one basket. Your initial placement is particularly important and needs to be considered very carefully, because sometimes your limited options can be attributed to an early mistake rather than a poor terrain card draw. Kingdom Builder is still a light strategy game in the end, but there are certainly strategic decisions to be made, and they do matter, even if luck plays some role as well. The location tiles generate a lot of clever tactical possibilities, and much of the game revolves around acquiring and exploiting these to strong-arm your way toward the kingdom builder card goals. Veteran players will argue that there's more strategy than meets the eye, especially with repeated play.

**Replayability: _very high_**. One of the best things about Kingdom Builder are the modular boards, each with their unique location tiles, and the random selection of kingdom builder cards. This means that your objections will be different each game, as will the means you have available to accomplish them. It makes each game a fresh experience and a unique puzzle to solve, and folks who _do_ enjoy the gameplay will find themselves coming back for more and more. The real fun of Kingdom Builder is trying to maximize the benefits of the location tiles in combination with the varied objectives afforded by the kingdom builder cards, and the mix of these elements will nearly always be different.

**Interaction: _moderate_**. Interaction in a two player game is somewhat limited, and there are not many opportunities to block your opponent or hamper his plans. With 3 or 4 players, your placement options become more limited, and players will need to jostle more for position in key areas of the map. Interaction is rarely nasty or about direct confrontation, but instead revolves around competing for similar goals, and at times thwarting your opponents' plans by shutting down opportunities that might benefit them.

**Scalability: _good for 2-4 players_**. Kingdom Builder works quite well regardless of the number of players. While interaction will happen most with the full complement of four players, it proves very satisfying and enjoyable as a two player game for couples as well, and we've actually played most of our games with just two players.

**Accessibility: _very good_**. The simplicity of the rules, combined with the short play time, attractive components, and perfect blend of luck/strategy devoid of viciousness makes Kingdom Builder ideally suited to introduce to non-gamers, friends and family, even though it may take them one or two plays to come to grips with the variable goals and location tile abilities, but despite this I think it has potential for a wide and immediate appeal. To illustrate: I've seen a 70+ year old grandmother become so enthused about the game after learning it, that she played it twice every night straight for the next week! There's good reason it won the 2012 Spiele des Jahres award!

**Expandability: _yes_**. Several expansions have been released (including a couple of smaller promos), thus extending the success of Kingdom Builder even further. [Kingdom Builder: Nomads][30] (2012) has been especially well received. It adds four new game boards with new location tiles (quarry, caravan, village, garden), along with three new kingdom builder cards (Families, Shepherds, Ambassadors), and the possibility of playing with 5 players. A second major expansion is expected to be available shortly, namely [Kingdom Builder: Crossroads][31] (2013). An app for iOS was also released at the end of last year, and is well worth checking out if you enjoy the game, especially if you're looking for something suitable for single-player games against a decent AI.

**Fun factor: _player dependent_**. Not everyone appreciates the challenge of a somewhat abstract type puzzle with variable goals and means. But those who do enjoy this kind thing will find Kingdom Builder immensely satisfying and enjoyable, and the strong replayability created by the variable combinations of location tiles and kingdom builder tiles will ensure that the fun doesn't quickly wear thin. My wife and I found it enormous fun, as did some other relatives we introduced the game to.

**What do others think?**

**The critics**  

![][33]

  
As good as Kingdom Builder is, it's not going to please everyone. Aside from the less strongly stated criticism that the interaction isn't significant (especially in two player games), there are two main reasons some folks raise as the reason for their dislike of Kingdom Builder:  
● The luck element is considerable, and many decisions are obvious or are made for you by your terrain card  
● It has a very abstract feel, with a relatively non-existent theme

The most outspoken critics found the gameplay overly dull, and noted that despite the replayability promised by the modular boards and cards, they simply had little interest in playing further. The heart of their criticism is that they found the game too light for their tastes, and in their view it didn't have enough meaningful decisions.

Even though the luck-element didn't dampen my own enthusiasm for the game, I can appreciate that hard core gamers might find it frustrating, especially initially. But is this an inherent weakness in the game's design? If it was a 90 minute strategy game, I could agree for sure. But given that it is a light gateway style game that can be played in 30-45 minutes, I think the balance between luck and strategy is quite acceptable. Yes it is quite dry, light, and even somewhat luck-dependent in so far as your choices are limited by the terrain cards, but Kingdom Builder doesn't pretend to be a serious medium weight strategy game, nor does it promise a deep thematic immersion. When assessed on the level of a solid gateway game, it meets the mark just fine, and there are enough decisions to prevent it being pure chaos or randomness, as long as you're not expecting something deeper or more strategic.

Furthermore, you will even find some gamers who make a case that the luck-element of Kingdom Builder is overstated, and that this criticism doesn't hold up to close scrutiny. As mentioned already in my conclusions about "Strategy" above, experienced players realize that initial placement of your settlements is of crucial importance, and the challenge is to overcome the limitation of the mandatory placement action through cleverly placing your settlements, and by exploiting the special actions of the location tiles. As such it is possible for good players to win more often than not. As evidence in support of this claim, one only needs to consider how hard it is to beat the AI on the iPad version of Kingdom Builder.

Those who really find the luck element distasteful might want to consider trying the popular house rule where players have two terrain cards in hand throughout the game, choosing one each turn.

**The praise**

There's more than enough enthusiastic folks offering a counter-point to the above, and the majority of gamers are brimming with enthusiasm over Kingdom Builder, particularly its accessibility and replayability, as is evident from very positive comments like these:

"Best kind of Spiel des Jahres winner. My favorite "gateway" game." - Max Lampinen   
"Love love love this game." - Robert Bowlds  
"The strategies that emerge from the interplay between location actions and goal cards is the true heart of the appeal of Kingdom Builder ... in many ways, Kingdom Builder surpasses Dominion by feeling even more elegant and timeless." - Eric Robinson  

![][34]

"Absolutely love playing this game. Fast paced, random every time and just good fun." - Lucas Fox  
"This is a simple yet really enjoyable game that I would compare to Carcassonne or Alhambra in complexity which makes it a perfect relaxing weeknight experience." - Laura R  
"Different game every time it's played, different map and different goals. Great re-playability!" - Jones42  
"Great replayability. Somewhat simple, but plays quick and has enough decisions to be made." - Toni Sallanmaa  
"Simple rules but enough depth and variability to make this a satisfying game." - Andy Evans  
"Varied game-play and short playing time makes this a popular choice for us." - Alan &amp; Susan  
"Excellent game. There are not many options and card drawing can hose you. However the puzzle it puts forward each game is satisfying." - David Foo  
"A very, very clever game that has much more depth and variety than first meets the eye." - Mikko Karvonen  
"This follow up to Dominion is a solid filler to any gamer's collection. Easy to explain to newbies with a ton of depth. Well done Mr. V!" - Spencer Sloe  
"To me, this is what a "euro" should be - deceptively simple, quick-playing, with some luck while leaving plenty of room for clever players to excel. The variable setup and scoring not only enhances replayability, but makes me eager to see what the next setup will be. Brilliant design." - David Bohnenberger   
"Great game. It's easy to teach, fast, each game feels different, and it has some interesting decisions to make." - Jeremy Frank   
"Really, this is almost the perfect game for our family. Short, colorful, different levels of depth, Tons of replayabilty, and fun. We love it!" - Rod McLain  
"Excellent re-playability. Straightforward. Easy to teach. Easy to learn. A bit light, but that's not a bad thing." - madhatter  
"I love it. Don't ask me why, it just hits the right spot between strategy, luck and fun. Each game is totally different due to the card draw, the objectives, and the maps." - Mary Weisbeck  
"This game is excellent in every possible way. Board is different every time, objectives are different every time, actions are different every time, short enough that losing doesn't hurt and long enough that you can execute an intelligent plan. It is simply the perfect Euro." - Graham Smallwood  
"If you think there is too much luck in this game, you didn't get it right." - Gustavo Alves  
"This is an excellent game, cleverly tuned and nicely variable, with short turns that are enjoyable to plan without triggering AP. It's got a puzzle quality to it, in a good way, and it lasts exactly as long as it should. It feels very polished, and it's relatively easy to teach (even to non-gamers)." - Martin Ralya   
"My favourite game in a long time. Seriously Stone Age may finally have some competition. Now my number 1 rated game." - John Bandettini   
"The great variety makes each game unique, and every move an interesting riddle. Its gameplay is amazingly deep, allowing for sophisticated actions and builds with rules easy enough for non-gamers. Its duration, easy scaling, pretty components and replayability mark this as a 10 for me." - Angelo Nikolaou

**Recommendation**

[**Kingdom Builder][3]** doesn't make a contribution to modern games in the same way as Vaccarino's previous effort [Dominion][4] did with its influential deckbuilding mechanic. Yet it is still a clever and excellent game that offers more that meets the eye. You can get hosed by the luck of the draw from time to time, but each game offers you a fresh challenge of goals, with a fresh combination of means to get there, and that will keep most players coming back for more every time again. While it won't satisfy gamers who are easily frustrated by some luck or who are looking for deeper strategy, it is the kind of game that will be successful with almost everyone else, and richly deserves the praise and generally positive reception it has received until now. A worthy Spiele des Jahres award winner!
