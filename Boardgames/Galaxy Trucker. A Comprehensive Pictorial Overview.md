# Ender's Comprehensive Pictorial Overview: A space cadet looks back at Vlaada Chvatil's wacky mega-hit from 2007 | Galaxy Trucker

![][1]

**Introducing Galaxy Trucker**  

![][2]

  
Designer Vlaada Chvatil has produced some of the biggest variety of game designs in recent memory, with serious strategy games like [Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization][3], cooperative games like [Space Alert][4], wacky party games like [Bunny Bunny Moose Moose][5], and light fillers like [Sneaks &amp; Snitches][6]. He also has an incredible sense of humor, and one of the games in which that is particularly evident is his 2007 hit, [**Galaxy Trucker][7]**.

In this somewhat puzzle-like game, players first race simultaneously to complete the building of their space craft, composed of an odd assortment of building components, and then in the second phase of the game send them into space, hoping that they will hold together in the face of meteor showers, space pirates, and other galactic dangers, while trying to pick up goods and trying to ensure that their space ship makes it through reasonably intact without having lost too many parts or its precious cargo.

Now I know that I'm very late to the party, because this game first came out already at Essen 2007. But I'm sure that there's more people out there who've never actually played it and are wondering if this is a game for them. Let me assure you, even if you're late to the party, it's still a party, so it's not too late to join the fun! Undoubtedly existing Galaxy Trucker fans will only be too happy welcome new space cadets into the fold, and help them learn how to fasten their seat belts and rocket off to party in distant galaxies! In fact, with a second expansion - one of the most anticipated game expansions for 2012 - reportedly on the way shortly, now's a great time to come on board. Galaxy Trucker may not be for everyone, but boy is it ever fun with the right people, and let's find out more by showcasing the second English edition.

**COMPONENTS**

**Game box**

The game box matches the typical size we've come to expect from most modern euros, and the cover art immediately introduces us to the subject of the game: space craft composed of an odd assortment of bits! To quote from the rules: "_Most space craft are protected from meteors by autotargeting gun turrets, self-guided missiles, or disintegration fields. Yours is protected by cannons made from sewer drills._"

![][9]

  
_Box cover of the second English edition_

The back of the box lists the components as well as a synopsis of game-play:  
"_In a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers – the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through hell. Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first? Of course you can. Become a galaxy trucker. It's loads of fun._"

![][10]

**Component list**

So what's all inside? If the amount of components is any indication, you certainly get good value here! Note that what you see here is the second English edition:

• 1 flight board  
• 1 double-sided flight board card for rounds 2 &amp; 3  
• 8 player rocket markers  
• 8 two-sided player ship boards  
• 144 space ship components  
• 40 grey astronauts  
• 8 aliens  
• 36 battery tokens  
• 56 goods cubes  
• 4 player order tiles  
• 60 adventure cards  
• 64 cosmic credits  
• 2 dice  
• 1 timer  
• 1 rulebook

![][11]

  
_All the game components_

**Flight Board**

The Flight Board is the key information piece in the game.   
• The circles numbered III, II, I and Start indicate where the timer will be placed at the start of the different rounds.   
• On the right is a handy reference chart showing some of the dangers that galaxy truckers can expect to face (small and large meteors, light and heavy cannon fire), and how to deal with them.   
• The circular loop is where players will put their rocket tokens, and measures flight days, indicating which player is currently leading the pack.   
• In the very middle is a reminder of point scoring that occurs at the end of each round, earned by having the leading ship, the most beautiful ship, and extra points earned for goods or lost for losing ship parts.

![][12]

  
_The game's central flight board_

In later rounds the points earned and lost will increase, and there's a double sided card provided which will be placed on the flight board in rounds II and III.

![][13]

![][14]

  
_Scoring reference cards for Rounds 2 &amp; 3_

**Rocket Markers**

These rocket markers (two in each of the four player colours) are used to keep track of the player flight days on the flight board. They're attractive and made of durable plastic.

![][15]

  
_Rocket markers in four player colours_

**Space Ship boards**

Your space ships will be constructed on different boards for each round. There's a space ship board for each player, with Round I on one side and Round II on the other. A second board is provided for Round III, with a bonus Round IIIa on the reverse side for advanced play.

![][16]

  
_Space ship boards for all three regular rounds of a game_

**Space Ship components**

You'll be building your ships on the boards using the 144 component tiles, which indicate over a dozen different elements.

![][17]

  
_All 15 types of tiles in the game_

Each part can be joined to adjacent parts using connectors – either a single connector or a double connector, while universal connectors have three connections and can be used adjacent to both. Your ship can have components on the outside of your ship that aren't connected to anything, but these are considered "exposed" and make your ship more vulnerable and less beautiful – we'll get to the downsides of that later. So let's take a look at the different types of bits which you can use to make up your rocket.

**Cabins**

Each player begins with a starting cabin in their colour, which has room for two astronauts. Additional cabins (white) can hold more crew, and you'll need crew for things you'll encounter in space, like abandoned space ships or abandoned space stations, so the more astronauts your bring along, the merrier!

![][18]

![][19]

**Engines**

These will power your space ship and make it faster, so the more you have the better. The exhaust must face the rear of your rocket. Engines can either be single or double.

![][20]

![][21]

**Cannons**

Cannons will help you deal with large meteors and will help make your space ship the most powerful when competing for some rewards in space. Just like engines, cannons can be either single or double.

![][22]

![][23]

**Shield Generators**

These will help deflect smaller meteors, and will protect you in the two directions each one is facing.

![][24]

**Batteries**

Shield generators, as well as double engines and double cannons are powered by batteries, which are discarded after every one-time use. Batteries compartments will store either 2 or 3 size E batteries (the E stands for E-normous!).

![][25]

![][26]

**Cargo Holds**

Cargo holds will store the point-scoring goods that you'll find in space, and can store either 1, 2, or 3 goods each, depending on their size. The red cargo holds will enable you to store the highest scoring red goods, which represent hazardous materials – they are smaller in size, and can hold regular goods as well.

![][27]

![][28]

![][29]

![][30]

**Structural modules**

These don't actually do anything, but they have lots of connectors and can help hold your ship together so it doesn't fall to bits too easily.

![][31]

**Alien Life Support Systems**

These components are required if you're going to have helpful aliens on board your ship, and need to be placed adjacent to a cabin to sustain alien life on board the ship. Purple aliens help increase your canon-power while brown/orange ones help increase your engine power.

![][32]

![][33]

**Space Ship contents**

You'll be placing various bits and pieces on the matching tiles:

**Astronauts**

These cute grey astronauts will go into the cabins, two in each.

![][34]

  
_The cute astronauts_

**Aliens**

Purple aliens add +2 to your cannon strength and orange/brown aliens add +2 to your engine strength. One can be placed in a cabin if it has a matching life support system adjacent to it.

![][35]

  
_Two types of aliens_

**Batteries**

These delightful translucent green cells will power your engines, cannons and shields, and 2-3 are placed on each battery component.

![][36]

**Goods**

These cubes represents the goods you'll find in space, and if you still have them at the end of your journey, you'll earn 4 cosmic credits for red cubes (these are the valuable hazardous materials, remember), 3 for yellow, 2 for green, and 1 for blue.

![][37]

  
_All the goods cubes_

**Turn Order markers**

These indicate the starting order of the players for the second phase of the game. Players take one of these when completing their rocket building in the first phase of the game, and in most cases the quickest to finish will select marker number 1, since being first in turn order is usually an advantage.

![][38]

  
_All the turn order tokens_

**Adventure cards**

The 60 adventure cards ramp up the difficulty from round to round.

![][39]

  
_Three decks of adventure cards_

They are used in the second phase of each round (there are 20 for each) to determine what happens to the player space ships. Basically they represent events, good ones like the discovery of planets or abandoned stations with point-scoring goods, or bad ones like meteor swarms, enemies, and combat zones.

![][40]

  
_Three decks of adventure cards_

**Cosmic credits**

These represent the points you'll earn during your adventures, and come in different denominations.

![][41]

  
_Cosmic credits come in five denominations_

To quote from the rules: "_Far more important than money, of course, is the thrill of adventure. And fame. And glory. And honor.. Oh who are we kidding? With enough money, you can buy adventure, fame, glory, and honor, and still have enough left over for dinner at a fancy restaurant._"

**Dice**

The two dice are used to determine where attacks or meteorites will hit your ship, and feature a lovely gold embossing on them. They're some of the nicest looking dice I've seen in a while!

![][42]

  
_Gold embossed dice_

**Timer**

The sand timer is used to limit the amount of time players have to build their space ships.

![][43]

**Rules**

The rulebook is a 16 page booklet. It may require a couple of reads to grasp the mechanics, but covers all the basics more than adequately. I especially loved the humor that spices it throughout.

![][44]

  
_Rulebook cover_

It contains ample illustrations and examples.

**GAME-PLAY**

**Set-up**

A game of Galaxy Trucker consists of three rounds, each of which has players simultaneously building their ship, and then simultaneously flying their ship and facing various adventures determined by the Adventure cards, a certain number of which (see the rules for more info on the specifics) are placed face down in three piles on the flight board. At the start of the game, each player gets their own Level I ship board, with a starting cabin in their colour on the central square. All the component tiles are placed face down, and you're ready to roll!

![][46]

  
_Ready, set, go!_

**Flow of Play**

Each round consists of two phases: building ships and flying ships.

**_Phase 1: Building your ship_**

It's always fun getting to build something, and that's certainly the case here! The timer is flipped on the space corresponding to the round, and now all players simultaneously take face-down tiles one at a time, and turn them face up, deciding whether or not to place them in their space ship adjacent to their existing tiles (which at the start of a round is just the central cabin).

**Real-time puzzling:** You may only use one hand to do this, and if you don't decide to keep it, you place it face up on the table from where anyone may choose to take it if they wish. None of this happens in an orderly fashion, because players don't take turns – it's simply fast and furious action, everyone scrambling to quickly find tiles that they need!

![][47]

  
_Racing to build a ship_

**Making connections:** As you're building your ship, you have to abide by the rules mentioned earlier when explaining how the tiles work, i.e. single and double connectors must match or be joined to a universal connector. In most cases you want to get cannons placed at the top of your ship, engines placed at the bottom of your ship, and in between a good balance of storage compartments, cabins, and perhaps some protective shields.

**Anticipating disaster:** You may look at the Adventure cards dealt face down at the start of the game to get some idea of what events will be coming up in the next phase of the game, to help you decide how to build your ship, but you don't want to waste too much time, because the player who is finished building first gets the advantage of being the leader, with his ship placed first on the flight track and subsequently first shot at getting good stuff (or being hit with bad stuff!).

**Equipping rockets:** When all ships are built, equip them with two astronauts per cabin and 2 or 3 batteries per battery tile. As for goods cubes, well you'll have to find those during your adventures in space!

![][48]

  
_A Class I ship in action_

**_Phase 2: Flying your ship_**

At this point everyone will have built their ships, and you'll add in a few more adventure cards as described in the rules, just to keep things interesting – this way you'll have had opportunity to look at some of the cards but not all of them! Our journey in space does need some surprises! So let's go find out how well our ships stand up to the rigours of space travel! The Adventure cards are now turned face up one at a time and resolved. Round 1 will have just 8, while further rounds will have 12 cards each. I won't explain every single card, but just to give you some idea of the things that can happen:  

![][49]

  
**Open Space:** Players move ahead on their flight track based on the number of their engines, with double engines only being included and counting as 2 if players expend a battery token.

**Planets:** Starting with the leading player, players can have the chance to decide to stop at a planet to pick up goods which are worth points at the end of the round.

**Abandoned Station:** If you have enough astronauts, you can get some goods – but only one player can do this, and players decide in order of their relative position on the flight track.

**Abandoned Ship:** If you have enough astronauts, you can decide to give some up in return for some cosmic credits – again the player in the lead getting first chance at this.

**Meteoric Swarm:** Everyone faces some meteors, which can come from the top, bottom, or one of the sides. The exact location is determined by rolling both dice, and this column or row is the one affected. Small meteors can be avoided if they bounce off a tile with no exposed connectors or if you expend a battery token to activate your protection shield, while large meteors can be avoided by shooting them with a cannon in the matching column/row. If you can't avoid them, you lose the component the meteor hits, as well as any others joined to it that are now disconnected from the rest of your ship.

**Enemies:** Cards featuring Smugglers, Slavers, and Pirates usually require the leading player to beat their cannon strength, which will come with a reward such as goods. If the leading player doesn't have enough fire-power to beat them, he must pay a penalty such as losing some of his most valuable goods, and the enemies then take on the next player in turn order.

![][50]

  
_Examples of some dangerous Enemies from Round 3_

There are other cards, but these are the more common ones and give some idea of how the game works. So as this phase progresses, you'll be shooting and deflecting things or possibly losing bits and pieces of your ship – in which case you set these tiles aside because they'll cost you points at the end of the round. Most of the adventure cards have a number on the bottom right, indicating the time these events take, and a player affected by an event or choosing to perform it must move his rocket back that many spaces on the flight track. By the time your ship has tackled the 8 or 12 adventures, it may be looking rather beaten up, and you'll be hoping that you haven't lost too many pieces (they'll charge you for that back at the office, you know!), and that you'll arrive fairly intact with a decent amount of point-scoring cargo!

![][51]

**Scoring**

At the end of the first round, rewards and penalties are given out according to the point-scoring chart on the flight board.

![][52]

  
_The Flight board at the end of a round_

Points are awarded as follows:  
• Players earn cosmic credits for their relative position on the flight track (4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively)  
• The ship with least exposed connectors gets 2 cosmic credits  
• Players get cosmic credits for any goods cubes they still have on board (red is worth 4, yellow 3, green 2, and blue 1)  
• For each tile you've lost along the way, you lose a point, up to a maximum of 5.  
In rounds 2 &amp; 3 most of these figures will change, with potential to earn more points.

To begin the next round, all components are returned except the cosmic credits earned, and you take the ship board corresponding to the next round, deal out random the appropriate number of adventure cards for that round, and start over – but this time with a bigger ship and bigger adventures! The player with the most cosmic credits after three rounds is the winner!

![][53]

  
_Great humor from the rulebook: "The player who has the most credits is a bit more of a winner than everyone else."_

**CONCLUSIONS**

**What do I think?**  

![][54]

  
**A Sense of Building**: One of the real strengths of Galaxy Trucker is that you're building something. What tiles are going to be part of your ship? That's all up to you! Do you want lots of cannons? Lots of engines? Are you going for something fast or something deadly, something beautiful (without exposed connectors) or something ugly but brutal? It's all your choice, and the final look of your ship really has your own signature on it. Sure, there's random tile draw that's happening, but you're not at all forced to play everything you draw, but can pick and choose as you like, so there's a real sense of building up something personal and making something. If engineers had invented tetris, they'd have called it Galaxy Trucker.

**A Sense of Ownership**: Closely linked to the previous point is the sense of personal ownership that develops as you build your ship. It's true that the second half of the game has a lot of luck of the draw, and once you've built your ship, you're now casting it off into the unknown, with relatively few decisions to make (aside from the occasional use of batteries or decisions whether or not to stop at planets or make other discoveries), at least in comparison with the first phase of each round. Yet that doesn't really matter, because the ship that you're now flying through various adventures is something you've built up yourself, and so it's something you care about. You may rue some of your building decisions, and at times wish you'd brought along more crew, firepower, or storage compartments, but even when things go wrong and lady luck deals with you harshly, the fact remains that the ship is your own creation, and if it is running short on cannons or engines then you have nobody to blame but yourself. And as it runs the gauntlet, you'll be willing it to succeed, because it's a like a child that you've produced and bears your own genetic stamp – you can't do much as you stand on the sidelines watching him run the 100m on school track and field day, but he's something you know and love, and you'll be cheering regardless of whether or not he wins or loses. That's exactly how the second phase of Galaxy Trucker feels. I can see that not everyone is going to like this second phase, because to some extent you are somewhat of a spectator, watching to see what happens to the pride and joy you've carefully built. Yet you are personally involved because it's the ship that you built with your hand, and there's the tension of how it will fare as it runs through the space gauntlet created by the adventure cards, evoking a sense of fun and excitement.  

![][55]

  
**A Sense of Accomplishment**: Regardless of whether or not you win or lose the game, you'll feel as if you've achieved something. Even if your ship starts falling to bits and everything goes wrong, there's still a sense of accomplishment, and you'll just be all the more determined to start over and build something better the next time around. The drive through the adventure deck is really all about testing your design, and you will have a sense of having made something, even if it all goes pear shaped when your space craft hits space.

**A Sense of Uniqueness**: Every ship you build will be different. As a result, the game feels new and unique every time again. You'll never build exactly the same space ship twice, and therein lies part of the beauty of the game, and the replayability. Furthermore, Galaxy Trucker is a unique brand of game - I can't think of anything quite like it. The real time puzzle building where you're racing against the clock to put your space ship together, and then the fun of sending it out to see how it fares, offers a game experience like no other. It's certainly something original - just like the space ship you'll put together each time!  

![][56]

  
**A Sense of Boyhood Adventure**: Who doesn't like the challenge of building personalized rockets and taking to the skies to explore distant galaxies and overcome the challenges of meteor showers and space smugglers? Well, maybe not everyone, but this theme certainly appeals very strongly to boys, and indeed anyone with a sense of adventure. It was no surprise that my sons particularly just loved this game and just wanted to play it over and over. One of them described it this way: "_I like the way you're building your own ship, and then flying it through space, encountering different events with it. Depending on how you build it, it will affect what happens, and it's never the same because each time you make a different ship._" It's great for boys and for men who wish they were still boys - or for anyone with a good love of boyhood adventure!

**A Sense of Fun**: If you read through comments and reviews there's one word that will come back time and again: Fun. It's fun if you win, but it's also fun if everything goes horribly wrong and your space ship is absolutely smashed to pieces. The game generates hilarity whether it's your opponent's space ship turning into a wreck or whether it's your own. Yes there's a lot of chaos and mayhem, but that only contributes to the laughs and entertainment.

**A (False) Sense of Complexity**: When you first read the rules, the flow of the game and intricacies of the different spaceship components and nuances of the different adventure cards may take a bit to wrap your head around. But truth be told, the game appears to be more complex than what it really is. Figuring it out from the rulebook alone may prove somewhat challenging, but it's easily explained firsthand in little more than 5 minutes, so watching a video review or two should help you learn the game in no time.

**A Sense of Expansion Potential**: A game like this certainly begs to travel far beyond the base game. Although there's more than enough replayability in the original game, serious space cadets will be glad to know that a very successful big expansion has also been released (cleverly named [Galaxy Trucker: The Big Expansion][57]), which offers new types of building components and adventure cards, and new ship classes; while another big expansion (even more cleverly named [Galaxy Trucker: Another Big Expansion][58]) is soon on the way and is eagerly anticipated.

![][59]

  
_The first edition in play - but things are never normally this neat in a real game are they?!_

**What do others think?**

**The criticism**

If it's all that good, why might you possible _not_ like this game? Well it's the kind of brand of excellence that is going to polarize people, and there are folks who hate it just as much as others love it. First of all, the randomness of the second phase of the game is more than some space cadets can handle. Not everyone can cope with having their beloved space ship fall to bits before their eyes while they're helpless to do much about it, and so the chaos and pandemonium that can be caused by the adventure cards won't appeal to all gamers. A second reason why some dislike the game has to do with the spacial puzzling under time pressure - this type of real-time competitive puzzle gameplay just isn't everyone's cup of tea. But these are subjective elements of taste rather than objective weaknesses in game design, and you'll have to decide for yourself into which camp you fall. Do be prepared to give it a chance, because even if you think rapidly puzzling together a ship and then sitting back to watch to see how it fares might not be for you, it could prove to be more fun than you'd expect.

**The praise**

Galaxy Trucker is currently ranked #65 on BGG, which is an absolutely impressive achievement given the style of game that it is. Here's what some of the fans of the game like about it:  

![][60]

  
"Love this game. Easy to teach and plays fairly quickly." - Adam Jones  
"The most fun you will ever have. Not deep-thinking long term strategy kind of fun. Drinking-game on a Tuesday night fun." - Matt Castro   
"Great game! Really fun and fast paced. Best game I invested in a really long time. The very simple but still challenging gameplay will have me hooked for years." - Henrik Skärnell   
"One of my favorite games. Always great laughs to see everyone get torn apart by the game." - Ryan Hendricks  
"Absurdly fun, fast-paced, and goofy, this is a go-to title in my collection." - Ananda Gupta  
"This game is just pure fun. Even if I come in last place, I love the experience! Real-time gaming in a board game is tough to do, but this game manages to get it right! Absolutely a game that can be introduced to any person, gamer or not, and they can have fun." - Scott Armstrong   
"Vlaada is a genius. Absolutely amazing. Played countless times. " - Simon Lundström   
"A perfect game. Unique, exciting, fun. Heck, it's even fun when you LOSE." - Shannon Appelcline  
"Just plain fricking fun! A puzzle game, in space, where you get to watch your ship get destroyed. I love the realtime element and don't mind the luck one bit. I would love to play this one every game night." - Scott Almes  
"BEST GAME EVER.. I love this game, I could play it all day. The right amount of planning, strategy, and all out randomness make it hilarious and fun to play even if you lose horribly." - Brian Stevenson   
"Incredibly addictive! Build a ship and blow it up, laughing all the way! GT is a refreshingly new theme and mechanic, the best new game to come around in a long time." - Greg Syferd  
"Absolutely, hands down, my number one game right now and for the forseeable future. Holy Mother of Acceleration is this game the bee's knees!" - Kevin Eagles   
"I have never before played a non-party board game that had this much laughter in it. Guaranteed fun time for all, regardless of who wins. Especially when you float home on one small piece of debris from what was your perfectly designed ship." - David Okerson   
"Best game ever for pure fun." - chuckhazard

![][61]

**Recommendation**  

![][62]

  
Is [**Galaxy Trucker][7]** for you? Well that is going to come down to your personal taste, but one can't fault the game itself when measured as a unique and successful design. Even if you're among those who find that the puzzling and chaos trumps the fun factor - and you're entitled to that opinion - it has to be admitted that Vlaada Chvatil has created a novel and successful game that does have a very big appeal, and has a proven record of success. A game this zany really shouldn't be in the BGG Top 100, and yet it is, and that in itself is proof of a remarkable achievement. So if you haven't yet had the opportunity to try shooting the moon or venturing to the stars with Galaxy Trucker, maybe now is the time to give it a shot - maybe you'll surprise yourself!
