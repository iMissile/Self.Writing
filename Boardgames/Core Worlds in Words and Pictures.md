# Core Worlds in Words and Pictures | Core Worlds

**The Prologue**

I'm not one to bury the lede. I really like this game, and rated it a 9 on the BGG scale. I should also disclose some of my relevant gaming preferences, so you can judge for yourself how much weight to give my opinion. There are games with similar mechanics that I love ([Ascension][1], [London][2], [Glory to Rome][3]), ones that I enjoy ([Eminent Domain][4], [San Juan][5]), and ones that I am only lukewarm about ([Dominion][6], [Thunderstone][7], [Race for the Galaxy][8]). In general, I really enjoy tableau developing, deck building, and VP engine driven games, and there aren't really any similar games that I flat out dislike.

On a side note, this is my first BGG review, and I decided to do it in a "full review" style, including a detailed rules overview, so I hope you all enjoy it.

"Waning." "Fading." "Decaying." All words used in the opening paragraph of the rule book to describe the Galactic Realm - the ancient empire upon which you'll take your barbarian fleet and wreak havoc. You're on a ten turn mission, racing from the galaxy's fringe to its core, conquering worlds and strengthening your military along the way. Your goal - make the powerful, influential core worlds a part of _your_ new empire. And of course earn more <strike>victory points</strike> Empire Points than your competition.

Core Worlds is the new medium weight hybrid deck builder from publisher [Stronghold][12] and veteran designer [Andrew Parks][13]. I have to give a thumbs up to Andrew here - he's been very accessible and active on these forums. It's always nice to have a responsive designer on hand to answer rules questions and enhance the BGG experience.

**The Pitch**

So, what's my one sentence Hollywood pitch for Core Worlds? It's a four currency deck builder that's Ascension meets Race for the Galaxy, with some Magic: The Gathering thrown in.

**Say What?**

It has Ascension's center row (but better) drafting, tableau building reminiscent of Race, and actions and persistent units with abilities that remind me of Magic. And yes, it has four currencies* as opposed to Ascension's two and Dominion's one.

*This may be a liberal usage of "currency," but I'd say it's energy, action points, fleet strength, and ground strength. Read on for more.

**Let Me Start at the Beginning**

The central mechanisms at work here are deck building, card drafting, and tableau construction.

The game takes place over ten turns, divided into five 2-turn sectors that you progress through sequentially. This is meant to model your fleet's progression from the galactic rim inward to the core worlds. Each sector has it's own Galactic Deck that, like Ascension, is used to fill the Central Zone with draftable cards and conquerable planets each turn. Each deck contains progressively better, and more expensive, Worlds, Units, and Tactics. The game culminates in Sector Five, played out over turns nine and ten, where the Galactic Deck contains nothing but the eponymous core worlds and special Prestige cards that provide Empire Points.

**How Does It Play?**

Briefly, your Worlds generate energy which you use to draft Units and Tactics. You play your Units to your tableau, here called the Warzone. You then use your Units to invade and conquer more Worlds, which in turn generate even more energy, allowing you to draft more and more expensive and powerful cards. Your Tactics cards can either strengthen your invasions, bolster your energy production, or provide other benefits. Almost everything costs an action point, which is a limited resource determined by which Sector the current turn is in. Thus is your engine built. Each core world gives a unique Empire Point bonus for having drafted certain card types, so a key strategy is to identify a target core world or two early and build towards conquering them. Core Worlds does follow most standard deck builder tropes - drafted cards go to the discard pile, unused cards and currency are lost at the end of the turn (with some small exceptions, which I'll cover later), and when your deck is exhausted, you shuffle your discard pile and start again.

**Home Base**

The central feature of your tableau is your player board. Here you will track your action points and energy. It also describes the turn flow and available actions. Most importantly, it lists the core worlds, their bonuses, and the requirements to conquer them. You will be planning for this the entire game.

**Card Types**

Core Worlds has three fundamental card types (plus the Sector 5 Prestige cards) -

_Units_ \- This is your military. As you can see below, there are several attributes. The top right number is the Empire Point value of the card at the end of the game. The top left number is the energy cost to play the card from your hand to your Warzone. The bottom left number (in the ship icon) is the fleet strength of the Unit, and the bottom right number (in the robot icon) is its ground strength. Dead center you'll see the unit type. There are infantry, vehicles, robots, starfighters, star cruisers, capital ships and heroes. You'll find that there is often profit in collecting multiple of the same unit type or of the same broad category (e.g. there is a star cruiser that is cheaper to play if you have a lot of starfighters).

![][16]

  
_

One each of the two types of units found in the starting deck.

_

_Worlds_ \- Your Worlds are your energy generators. When a world is conquered it goes directly to your Warzone and generates energy in the amount of the top left number each turn. To successfully invade a world, you will have to discard from your Warzone any amount of Units such that their combined fleet strength equals or exceeds the planet's fleet strength _and_ their combined ground strength equals or exceeds its ground strength. The Empire Point value for Worlds, like all cards, is at the top right.

![][17]

_Tactics_ \- These are your actions. Most of them actually don't cost an action point to play; you only have to pay the energy cost on the top left. They typically either give a conditional bonus during an invasion, or provide bonuses during the energy generation or draw phases.

![][18]

**The Factions**

There are five factions that you can play, each with a unique hero card, giving them a slightly asymmetric quality that adds some nice flavor. The starting decks are otherwise identical, and consist of 16 cards including five each of the two basic military Units, four Tactics, a support robot, and your faction hero. There is also a single home world card (which generates 3 energy) that begins in play in your Warzone.

**The Turn**

_Draw Phase_

You start a turn by drawing cards up to a hand size of six (seven in rounds nine and ten). Core Worlds follows the path pioneered by Dominion, but with a twist - at the end of the turn, instead of discarding your entire hand, you can optionally choose a single card to hold on to as you go into the next turn.

_Energy Generation Phase_

You'll set your energy track marker to the combined total of the energy generated by your conquered Worlds. Any "during your energy phase" Tactics cards can be played now for 0 action points. I'll point out here that the "Energy Surge" tactic card (see the Tactics card section above) is a great catch-up tool that comes included in all starting decks. If you're behind anyone else in energy production, you can play it for a 2 energy bump, which can be significant. Energy is zeroed out at the end of the turn and never carries over turn to turn.

_Galactic Phase_

Then comes the galactic phase, wherein 2X+2 cards (where X is the number of players) are dealt from the current Galactic Deck to the Central Zone. The only other point of interest here is that, to ensure a variety of targets, you may have to deal out more than X cards. There must be at least as many Worlds and _non_-Worlds as there are players. So in a three player game there must always be at least 3 Worlds and 3 Tactics or Units.

![][20]

  
_

_

There's a little bit of housekeeping to be done here as well. There may be some cards that go undrafted in a given turn. They aren't immediately discarded. In fact, a given card can stay in the Central Zone for a maximum of two turns. On the second turn, they will be given a "bounty" and one energy token will be placed on them. If any cards with a bounty go undrafted (which is to say if they're still around for a third turn) then at that point they are discarded. So that means that you aren't necessarily seeing all new cards every turn; the Central Zone will just be "filled up" until you fulfill both conditions (at least 2X+2 cards, and at least X of each type of card). If a card with an energy token is drafted or conquered, then that player gets 1 bonus energy to spend that turn.

_Action Phase_

Then we have the meat of the game - the action phase. Here, players take turns performing one of four actions (or passing). When you run out of actions, your turn is over even if you have energy left. If you pass for any reason, your turn is also over.

The actions are:

_Draft a card_ \- This phase can be a race against the other players to grab the best and most useful Units and Tactics. For the cost of one action point, you can pay a card's draft cost in energy and send the card directly to your discard pile. The draft cost can be found in the middle of the card, to the right of the card type.

_Deploy X Units_ \- For the cost of one action point per Unit, and the Units' energy costs (found in the top left corner), you can play as many Units to your Warzone as you want/can afford. These Units can be used as soon as later in the same turn to invade a World.

_Invade_ \- By paying one action point and one energy, you can invade one World. To do so, you have to discard enough Units from your Warzone to equal or exceed _both_ the fleet strength and ground strength of your target World. Any "during an invasion" Tactic cards can be played here for 0 action points. Conquered Worlds go directly into play in your Warzone.

Currently, the only method of deck thinning available in the game is that, when you conquer a World, you can tuck a participating basic military Unit (grunt or snub fighter) under the World as a garrison, effectively removing it from your deck for the rest of the game.

_Tactics_ \- There are a number of "as an action" Tactic cards available to draft, and these are played as a lone action, costing one action point and the associated energy cost.

_Discard Phase and End Phase_

Here you'll discard unused cards (keeping 1 for the next turn if you want), reset your energy, move the turn marker to the next space, and pass the start player marker one place to the left.

**Winning**

No surprise here. The victor is the player with the most Empire Points total, including cards in their deck, discard pile, and in play in the Warzone. There are a handful of cards that will give you bonus Empire Points for being in play in your Warzone at game end, but they are few and far between. My group experienced a tie on the first play, so we had to go to the first tiebreaker - the player who has the highest energy production from their Worlds. The second tie breaker is the number of conquered Worlds.

**The Optional (Yet Awesome) Pre-Game Draft**

The rulebook recommends skipping this step in your learning game, which makes sense, but I strongly suggest doing this on your second play. It's a great addition. There are twelve unique draft cards included. One each of the Snub Fighter and Galactic Grunts in your starting deck are removed and each player will draft two cards to replace them.

![][22]

  
_

The twelve draft cards let you further customize your starting deck.

_

Before the game, you'll deal out 2X+2 cards (with X being the number of players), which is the same number as you'll deal out to the Central Zone during the game. Then, beginning with the start player, conduct a "snake" style draft. First player, second player, third player, fourth player, then fourth again, third, second and finally first.

This lets you further differentiate your starting deck, enhancing the asymmetry that I really enjoyed, and focus your strategy before you even start.

**My Thoughts**

I think Core Worlds is fantastic. It succeeds on almost every level, and is probably the best iteration yet of deck-building as a central mechanic.

As a deck-builder it has substantial strategic depth and you're given some really tough decisions to make. It's very _tight_, in a way that reminds me of [Agricola][23], where there's just that _one more thing_ I really want to do, but my resources are too constrained to make it happen. It's also the first deck-builder that has a set number of turns, and that really changes things as compared to, say, [Dominion][6]. There are a handful of cards that will let you draw extra cards, or redraw even, but assuming you don't get them into play, you're only going to see a maximum of 62 cards in your hand the entire game. That is _not_ that many. There's no endless reshuffling here and that feels right. As the game progresses, you're going to see less and less of the cards you draft. There's a real chance that you'll never see some of the cards you draft in the late game. This reality makes for some agonizing drafting decisions. Do I gamble and spend nine energy to draft that huge capital ship that I need to conquer that core world, but may never see the light of day? Or do I do the safe thing and spend that energy on the lesser Units in my hand now?

It also succeeds as a tableau development "economic" Euro. And it feels _very_ different than the others I have played ([Eminent Domain][4], [London][2], [Race][8], [San Juan][5]). To me there is a strong whiff of [Magic: The Gathering][24] here - you're playing persistent fighting units (i.e. creatures), some of which have Magic-esque abilities. For example, there is a Sector 2 infantry card Flame Troopers with an ability that lets you discard cards in your hand to increase its ground strength for each discard. My mind immediately piped up with "that's firebreathing from Magic!" I say this as a compliment; I think it works well here. Some Units you'll end up keeping in play in your Warzone to provide you directly with bonuses or abilities, and others you'll keep in play to make your other Units stronger and/or cheaper. So your Warzone isn't merely a stopping off point between your hand and an invasion.

Core Worlds does have some common tableau developing ground with both [Race for the Galaxy][8] and [Eminent Domain][4], if only because both of those games also see you conquering worlds to your tableau and both also have two different costs to consider (military/colonize). Truthfully, Core Worlds is very distinct and stands on its own as a game that may well be used as a point of reference in the future. "Well, it's like Core Worlds, but...."

I'll also admit that I do think of ground strength and fleet strength as two more "currencies," in addition to action points and energy. To me, that makes Core Worlds quite a bit more complex, and to me more satisfying, than its contemporary deck building competition. So you pay energy and action points to buy Units, then you pay more energy and action points to _play_ the Units, and finally you use those Units to "buy" first more energy production and eventually Empire Points.

Finally, I think the replayability quotient here is high. There are 5 different slightly asymmetric factions, a customizing pre-game draft, and a variety of strategies to pursue. Even better though, is that a good number of the 120 Galactic cards don't see play in any given game. The amount will vary depending on the number of players of course, but I'd estimate that, in a four player game, 20-25% of the cards don't even make it to the Central Zone to be drafted. That number jumps to around 35-40% for a 3 player game. This will certainly ensure game to game variety.

**What about the components?**

Well this is a card game, so let's look at the cards. First off, they are "standard card game size" at 2.5in. by 3.5in (63.5mm by 80mm). That's Fantasy Flight gray for you sleevers out there (of which I am one). There is a pleasant linen texture to the cards, which I prefer over the comparatively lifeless matte look. Colors pop, colors are consistent, and everything looks great. The player boards are light card stock, which certainly works, though cardboard would have been better. The counters are all cardboard and they punch clean, so no complaints. The box itself looks great, but is bigger than it needs to be by at least a few inches. The box insert vexes me somewhat - the player boards don't quite fit and they end up having to bend a little bit. Your mileage may vary. Insert tossed. Problem fixed. It also came with more than enough plastic baggies to hold everything. Thank you for that Stronghold; I'm always annoyed when I have to go hunt down component storage.

**But is it fun?**

Yes! Theme and gameplay come together beautifully here. The theme is more than just pasted on. The limited turn track, the progressively more expensive/better Galactic decks, and the Sector 5 core worlds really do help to give the feel that you're flying along through the galaxy, haphazardly conquering worlds and pressing units into military service, on your way to vie for the big prize. It's no [Twilight Imperium][26] or [Mansions of Madness][27], but the theme and mechanics do come together better than some of its competition like, in my opinion, [Eminent Domain][4].

**Any complaints?**

Some minor ones.

The player boards aren't as rugged as they could be. I'd have preferred cardboard, like the similarly sized [7 Wonders][28] player boards.

The card art is high quality with a cool blocky retro-future vibe, but I'm much less enamored with the card layout which, while functional, is only okay. At least give me black borders! Non-sleevers may disagree with that sentiment, however, since white bordered cards tend to show less wear than black bordered cards.

In order to compensate for turn order advantage, players that are the start player less often than their fair share receive one or two "Energy Surge" tokens. My complaint is that they share a name, and art, _but not effect_, with the Energy Surge Tactic card. The Tactic card can only be used during the Energy Generation phase and is worth 1 or 2 energy depending on the game state, whereas the token can be used at any time and always gives 2 energy. This game does have a learning curve. There is a lot of information to process, and card text to read, to really grok the rules and basic strategy. The shared name caused confusion for the five people I've taught the game to so far. The token has no text however, so it puzzles me that it was given a potentially confusing name. If I had one recommendation for a second printing, it would be to rename the Energy Surge token, even if the art is kept, to something unique.

**Parting Words**

I strongly recommend Core Worlds. It's a great medium weight game and, in my eyes, the most successful hybrid deck builder yet. Get it and enjoy!

Thanks for reading and I hope this was interesting and helpful!
