# A Pictorial Overview: An edition of Puerto Rico with illustrated buildings - isn't it about time? | Puerto Rico

**Introducing Puerto Rico**  

![][2]

  
[Puerto Rico][3] enjoyed a long reign of dominance for several years at the top of the BGG rankings. And even though it tussled with Agricola for the number one spot for some time, and has since been passed by the current #1 Twilight Struggle, it still enjoys a strong following, and can rightly be considered a quintessential and highly influential euro that offers much enjoyment and replayability for gamers.   

![][4]

  
Yet there is one respect in which Puerto Rico is showing its age. After all, it's been around since 2002, so it first appeared almost a decade ago! For the most part it has stood the test of time, and its gameplay holds up well even when measured by the standards of the latest and newest crops of games - many of which are indebted to it and influenced by it. But if there is an aspect that could be improved, it's that the components could do with a visual makeover, particularly the building tiles. The plain text-only purple buildings are starting to look somewhat vintage and austere, and are just not up to snuff when compared with the artistic production values witnessed in the components of most newer euro games today.

In this review, I'm not going to address the gameplay of this modern classic - there's already 77 reviews that cover that more than satisfactorily, and I doubt that we need a 78th. But what I will review are some of the components, and more specifically, I'll review some of the illustrated tiles that are available for the game (if you know where to look for them!).

**THE ORIGINAL ARTWORK**

**The buildings in Puerto Rico**  

![][5]

  
By the standards of 2002, when the game was released, Puerto Rico was a fairly impressive product even for its own time. We're not just talking about the game-play here - that, obviously, was outstanding for its time, as the history of modern euro games has more than amply demonstrated since. But the components themselves had enough about that them that was attractive - the colonists were made out of solid wood tokens (many editions even came with extras in case you lost some), and the tiles and boards were constructed out of thick durable card. There was even enough artwork to help enhance the overall effect, with some nice illustrations on the role tiles, player boards, and plantation tiles.

It was - even for its time - a fairly polished product, except perhaps for one thing: the building tiles. The various production buildings were at least distinguished by colour, which served well to make gameplay easier, but the violet buildings were just that: violet. Plain violet. Not that I dislike violet, but I do like pictures. Part of the reason for the plain look, of course, was due to the need for the violet building tiles to contain the necessary text which explained their unique effects. And certainly they've served their purpose well. But as euro games have come to generate some serious momentum in the wider world of gaming - much of it even owing to Puerto Rico - we've also come to see higher production values. There's good reason to think that if Puerto Rico had been produced by a large and successful modern game publisher today, we'd at least have seen some illustrations on these tiles.

**The buildings in San Juan**

We fast forward to Puerto Rico becoming a parent. In 2004, Puerto Rico begat a son: [San Juan][9]. This card game featured many of the same buildings and ideas, but with the larger canvas available due to the introduction of playing cards, the talents of renowned game artist [Franz Vohwinkel][10] were harnessed to provide the artwork for the various buildings featured in San Juan. Vohwinkel was illustrator for the original game, and a plethora of other well known game titles. You can admire some of his artistic skills at his personal website, [www.franz-vohwinkel.com][11].

The results were beautiful, and San Juan succeeded not just on the level of transforming much that gamers loved about Puerto Rico into a card game, but now also included some wonderful artwork.

**UPGRADING THE ARTWORK**

**From San Juan to Puerto Rico**

Is there a way to teach an old dog new tricks? And would there be a way to get this wonderful artwork from San Juan back into the original game that had inspired and fathered it? When I stumbled across this image, I knew that the answer was: yes!

![][13]

This takes the beautiful artwork of Franz Vohwinkel on the San Juan cards, and implements it for the Puerto Rico tiles.

**The Base Game**

So how did we arrive at these wonderfully illustrated tiles? There is a story behind the illustrated Puerto Rico buildings that you see here, and it begins with BGG user [Sebastien Pauchon][15]. In 2005 he undertook the ambitious project of porting the images from the cards of San Juan to the building tiles of Puerto Rico. What you see here is the fruits of his work, which first appeared in the BGG image gallery [here][16] and [here][17], and which he made available on his personal website [pauchon.com][18] (for personal and non-commercial use only) in more than half a dozen languages. (Note: the tiles pictured below show Pauchon's work as it was later reworked and supplemented by others involved in the project).

So how does it come together? It's functional and beautiful:

![][22]

  
_The game in play with illustrated tiles_

**Expansion #1: The New Buildings**

Sebastien Pauchon had also made similar tiles for the official expansion ([here][23]), and with some adjustments these were translated into English by [Mateusz Nowak][24] ([here][25]).

![][26]

**Expansion #2: The Nobles**

When a second expansion appeared for Puerto Rico along with the first in Alea's [Treasure Chest][28], BGG user [kungfro][29] decided to take up the torch, and continue the project ([here][30]). With the help of [Grzegorz Kobiela][31], he adapted some of the images from the San Juan expansion cards, and made various other adjustments and edits to the overall work.

![][32]

**EDITIONS WITH ILLUSTRATED BUILDINGS**

**Print-and-play**  

![][33]

  
The initial project is available on Sebastien Pauchon's website [www.pauchon.com][18]. The current and more complete form of the project, as polished by kungfro, is in the BGG files. Here you can download a 3 page PDF, with all the buildings in their illustrated glory, including the buildings from the original game, as well as ones from the first official expansion, and the second expansion that appeared in the Alea Treasure Chest:

![][34]

But now how to translate this wonderful concept into print? I could never make this myself, because I lack the technical expertise and skills for producing print-and-play products. Enter this young man: [Andrew Tullsen][35], who is very active here on BGG. Andrew is an enterprising BGGer who runs his own print-and-play production. He specializes in making prototype games, for example, for designers who self-publish. In other words, Andrew has the very skills I lack, and was just the guy I needed to turn this digital concept into real tiles for me. I'm happy to put in a plug for him - you can read all about his services on his extensive geeklist ([here][36]).

Andrew usually needs a month or two to put something together, but I was more than happy to cover his costs, and although it meant some waiting time, the end result was more than worth it. A few comments on the quality of the tiles, in the interests of full disclosure: As far as I can tell, the tiles have been hand cut, and so there are some tiles that have on their edge a thin strip of the colour of the adjacent tile. A couple of tiles appear to be from the edge or corner of the cardboard sheet, and the printing didn't completely cover everything, resulting in a sliver of cardboard visible along the edges. If you're a perfectionist, you might find these things irritating, which is why I mention them. But I can overlook them, because in the larger scheme of things they are only minor niggles, and the overall result looks fantastic, and I'd much rather be playing with these illustrated tiles than the more mundane and dull look of the original ones! They're also double-sided, and made of thick cardboard stock. The pictures you see above are the tiles Andrew Tullsen made for me, so judge for yourself how good they look. It adds tremendous aesthetic appeal and somehow adding some more visual appeal seems to help enhance the game experience in an unexplained way, so I'm happy with the result.

_Illustrated buildings at game setup_

As an added bonus, in addition to the two expansions, kungfro's file also includes artwork for replacing the original Factory and University buildings with adjusted tiles that reflect the suggestions of the designer for improved gameplay. For those who are unfamiliar with this variant, apparently in an interview the designer and developer have remarked that if they were to have made the game today, they would have reversed the costs of the Factory and the University, in order to make the often neglected University more attractive, and without eliminating the viability of the powerful Factory. For details and discussion, see [here][38] and [here][39].

**Commercial editions**

**French edition**

Will a commercial edition with illustrated buildings ever see the light of day? In March 2010, publisher Filosofia [announced][41] a French edition featuring Sébastien Pauchon's work incorporating the San Juan artwork. Although complete component sheets reflecting the artwork of this new edition are available in high resolutions from their website (see the links at the bottom of [this page][42]), I've not seen pictures of this in print, so I can't confirm whether this edition ever became a reality.

![][43]

**Polish edition**

A [Polish edition][44] published by Lacerta has appeared, which includes the [expansion][45], and features colourful artwork on the building tiles, although it's quite different from the San Juan artwork by Vohwinkel.

_Mike Doyle's role cards_

Many enthusiastic gamers have tried their hand at a complete redesign of Puerto Rico. Among them is [Karim Chakroun][49], who has contributed to the artwork and graphic design on numerous games. You can read about his work on a custom redesign [in this thread][50].

Arguably even more impressive is the amazing work by highly respected board game artist [Mike Dyole][51]. He's not just come up with new artwork for the current components, but a complete and radical overhaul of the game and how the boards work - without changing the actual gameplay. There's [debate][52] about the extent to which the component changes successfully converts the game's mechanics to make them more functional, but one thing is clear: it's a thematically impressive presentation, and judged purely on the basis of aesthetics it's absolutely outstanding. Details about his concept and accompanying artwork can be found on his blog [here][53] and [here][54].

![][55]

  
_Mike Doyle's vision for a completely redesigned game board_

There's a lot more we could show - over the years many keen gamers have upgraded their copies of Puerto Rico with a variety of creative and impressive additions and enhancements.

**Puerto Rico: The 10th Anniversary Edition**

**A case for an edition with illustrated buildings**  

![][60]

  
I'm very pleased to be playing a copy of the game with illustrated buildings. No, it doesn't really affect the gameplay, but it makes for a more enjoyable experience, and helps prevent Puerto Rico from showing signs of its age, and puts it more on par with the kind of components seen in most newer games. As such, it helps this classic retain some of its appeal for a new generation of gamers who might be coming across it for the first time, and adds an extra layer of things to appreciate for long-time players of the game like myself.

Unfortunately most of us wouldn't have the technical expertise to produce something like what's shown above - at least, not something of any real durable quality. And let's be honest, most of us aren't interested in doing that either - we'd much rather see a commercial edition with a higher standard of artwork, that we can buy straight off the shelf in our local game store. In other words, what we really want is for the publisher to step up to the plate and do this for us.

And why not? As many others have said, it seems like a no-brainer thing to do, and there's good reason to think such a move would be commercially viable. Puerto Rico is still a strong seller, and there's good reason to expect its popularity to continue, despite the wide variety of new games appearing on the market. I believe that an upgraded edition of the game - at the very least featuring illustrated building tiles - would be very well received by longtime fans of the game, and perhaps convince them to retire their well-worn copy in favour of a more visually appealing game. Furthermore, it could go a long way to making the game more endearing to people playing it for the first time.

**A plea to the publisher**

2012 will mark the 10th anniversary of Puerto Rico. This would be an ideal time to put out an upgraded edition of the game, which could include the above illustrated building tiles, and perhaps some extras. A deluxe version of the game could also include some of the expansions, perhaps some rule variants and tweaks (e.g. the Factory - University price swap), certainly the rules for the official two player variant, and maybe some other component upgrades. If that's too much to ask, then at very least an edition that includes Franz Vohwinkel's artwork on the building tiles would already go a long way to improving the visual appeal of the game.   

![][61]

  
Puerto Rico is a fantastic game, and its enduring appeal is fast from fading, so if any game deserves this kind of makeover, Puerto Rico is the one. It's been a big seller both in Europe and North America, so it would seem that the numbers would back this up. The gameplay is strong enough to compete with the best of today's games, and is success will be ongoing on the strength of its established reputation, if only it's supported by components that match the quality and visual appeal of the newer games emerging off the press. By the looks of things most of the hard work has already been done, because digital versions of the concept for illustrated buildings are ready to go. The tenth anniversary in 2012 would be the perfect time to make this happen.

Clearly I'm not alone in expressing such sentiments. There's already at least one thread on BGG, pleading for the publishers to produce an edition of the game with higher production values, and perhaps a few other small tweaks:

[Puerto Rico – 10th Anniversary Edition?][62]

How about it Alea, and Rio Grande? You publish it, people **will** buy it! An edition of Puerto Rico with illustrated buildings - isn't it about time?
