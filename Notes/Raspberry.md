- COOL! [Raspberry Pi. Written by Matthew Kirk. Connecting the Temperature Sensor](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/temperature/). In this tutorial, we will be building a circuit to connect a temperature sensor to our Raspberry Pi, and writing a program to read the sensor data. The circuit we will build is going to connect to the Raspberry Pi using the GPIO pins.
