	- Holding Keys Down at the Same Time.
To specify that any combination of SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT should be held down while several other keys are pressed, enclose the code for those keys in parentheses. For example, to specify holding down SHIFT while "e" and "c" are pressed (e and c keys are "mated"), use {SHIFT}(ec). To specify holding down SHIFT while "e" is pressed, followed by c without SHIFT, use "{SHIFT}ec".
