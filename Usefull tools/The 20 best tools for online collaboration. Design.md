# The 20 best tools for online collaboration | Design

A team of designers does not always work in the same office; you work in distributed groups, some of you may be [working from home][1], and clients can be based all over the world. This is where collaboration tools come in - they make it easier and faster for designers to get feedback and approve artwork in a professional manner, and they come in all sort of forms, from [free Android apps][2] to [Chrome extensions][3].

Some are created specifically for designers, some serve as a concept crafting whiteboard often with tools to make simple annotations, and some are all-in-one web apps that include an element of project management.

Here we gather together some of the best available online tools to allow designers to take part in collaborational work in real time. There are collaboration tools, from concept drafting and brainstorming to working on mock-ups and live project, and we've also included some more full-on project management tools for when you need to take your collaborative project to the next level.

### 01\. [Trello][4]

![Trello][5]Share your to-do list with others in real time using Trello

This project management tool is like a magical customisable to-do list on a single interface, which you can share with others in real-time.&nbsp; Based on a system of 'cards', (which are essentially post-it notes), you can categorise and order text, photos, drawings and mock-ups whichever way you want. There's also a nice progress meter so you can keep an eye on your project's pipeline, as well as the ability to set appointment reminders. Most brilliantly of all, it's free.

### 02\. [Yammer][6]

![Yammer][7]Yammer is a social network for business owned by Microsoft

A social network for business, Yammer provides a platform for you to communicate and collaborate privately with your colleagues. Employees sign in with a company email address and can use the platform via web, desktop or mobile to chat openly or privately, and share documents; you can even like somebody's status if you so wish! With over 7 million users, it's the most widely used enterprise network tool and, now owned by Microsoft, can be integrated with SharePoint.

### 03\. [Flatsi.es][8]

![Flatsi.es][9]Share concepts with clients using Flatsies

Forget the frustrations of sending work to clients via email; this free tool for designers enables you to host your project on one dashboard and share via a simple URL. Projects are password protected so only you and the client have access to them. Other features include retina-ready so that all of your images look pristine, and a mobile app means that you can use the tool wherever, whenever. The free version allows you to manage four projects at a time, while the paid-for pro account is unlimited.

### 04\. [Red Pen][10]

![Red Pen][11]Want constructive criticism? This feedback tool makes it easier

More fun than a teacher's marking pen, this feedback tool is particularly great if you're a freelancer and looking for some constructive criticism on a project. Specifically created for designers, Red Pen lets you drag and drop your designs into a dashboard and invite specific colleagues (or even clients) to let you know their thoughts in real-time as you roll out your latest updates to a project. One of its best features is that it keeps track of the numerous versions made so you can always reclaim that earlier design if you changed you mind. Pricing starts at $20/month for 5 projects.

### 05\. [Invision][12]

![Invision][13]Invision is a web and mobile app created specifically to help designers collaborate

Again, another tool created specifically for designers, Invision is a web-based and mobile app that turns your designs into fully active prototypes with gestures, transitions and animations. Clients can provide feedback in the form of comments on your designs , and you can keep them up to date with the project's progress in real time through actionable to-do lists. Getting started on your first project is free, but any more will cost you from $15/month.

### 06\. [Mural.ly][14]

![HTML5 - Murally][15]Gathering and sorting ideas and resources in different formats

Mural.ly is a creative tool for you to drag-n-drop rich media files, links, and documents onto a big HTML5 drawing board, which is a great way to collect inspiration and gather thoughts. It also supports collaboration that allows designers to brainstorm cool ideas remotely. Plus, it is optimized for iPad and made gesture-friendly.

Mural.ly is not just designed as a pinboard like Pinterest - its main goal is gathering and organizing ideas. Anyone can join you to edit and collaborate, and changes are reflected on the board in real-time. Just send an e-mail invitation or set up a password for the board and you are ready to go.

Tools like this are lighter than some of the more traditional brainstorming tools, and if you're new to collborative brainstorming then this could be a good place to get started.

### 07\. [GoVisually][16]

![ GoVisually 1][17]GoVisually allows you to comment, annotate, and discuss

Free tool GoVisually allows you to mark annotations and place comments on any part of your project - so designers and clients can collaborate to revise projects online without sending painful e-mails, which should ultimately increase productivity.

Elliptical, rectangular, and lasso selections are available for annotation - you can easily select these options at the top of the screen, as well as colour and weight of the shapes. These functions are very useful, and are as simple to apply as you'd find in a basic drawing app.

When multiple team members are on the same page, GoVisually applies layers for each user, like in Photoshop. Clicking on each user hides or displays relevat content, which is particularly useful when collaborating with different departments. Revisions can be easily upload and it is simple to switch between different versions of the same document or project.

### 08\. [MindMeister][18]

![ MindMeister][19]Mindmeister is a collaborative mind-mapping tool

[Mindmeister][18] is a powerful mind-mapping tool, but also has the functionality of many collaboration tools. Designers can use this to craft ideas and concepts. It's maybe a bit quirky to organise a design idea through mind mapping, but this is still a great collaboration tool to try out.

### 09\. [ConceptBoard][20]

![][21]

[ConceptBoard][20] is an instant whiteboard tool for teams and projects. Creative designers can reap benefits by using this tool to collaborate as well.

![ GroupZap][23]GroupZap is a simple board with a skeuomorphic-style layout

Think of this app as any whiteboard in a boardroom! [GroupZap][22] is a tool for you and your team to collaborate on ideas in real-time.

### 11\. [Scribblar][24]

![ Scribblar][25]Scribblar is the only app here that also has live audio chat capabilities

[Scribblar][24] is more like a chat room - it even has audio available - and as such it is very useful indeed. Creative brainstorming and artwork revision can be collaborated in the 'room' you create. It's an effective online collaboration tool and is available for free.

![][33]The latest version of Concept inbox features visual feedback and realtime collaboration

### 16\. [Cage][34]

![ Cage][35]If you want an online collaboration tool that's specifically for designers, try Cage

Cage is one of those collaboration tools that is specifically built for designers. The original Cage allowed you share images of designs and get contextual feedback on them, but in the latest iteration of the app collaboration is more comprehensive.

### 17\. [Draftboard][36]

![ Draftboard][37]Draftboard is specifically designed to work with PSD files

If Cage is for gathering feedback on image-based works, Draftboard is designed for managing and collaborating on mock-ups - specifically&nbsp; Photoshop .psd files.

The overall layout and functions are almost the same as Cage, including annotation, managing multiple projects, and collaboration tools. It's a good, basic tool to share mock-ups, get feedback, and keep your team updated.

### 18\. [Canvasdropr][38]

![ Canvasdropr][39]A blank canvas to drop and share your documents on - that's Canvasdropr

Canvasdropr is a file sharing and annotating tool that supports many filetypes, even including MS Office documents. The interface is very simple and easy to navigate.

### 19\. [Marqueed][40]

No fancy features or price plans here - Marqueed is a free, simple tool to upload images and discuss them.
